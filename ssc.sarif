The data used to dynamically construct an XPath query.\n\n\nIn this case the query is passed to  in  at line .\n\n\nExample 1: The following code dynamically constructs and executes an XPath query that retrieves an e-mail address for a given account ID.  The account ID is read from an HTTP request, and is therefore untrusted.\n\n...\nString acctID = request.getParameter(\"acctID\");\nString query = null;\nif(acctID != null) {\n       StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(\"/accounts/account[acctID='\");\n       sb.append(acctID);\n       sb.append(\"']/email/text()\");\n       query = sb.toString();\n}\n\nDocumentBuilderFactory domFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\ndomFactory.setNamespaceAware(true);\nDocumentBuilder builder = domFactory.newDocumentBuilder();\nDocument doc = builder.parse(\"accounts.xml\");\nXPathFactory factory = XPathFactory.newInstance();\nXPath xpath = factory.newXPath();\nXPathExpression expr = xpath.compile(query);\nObject result = expr.evaluate(doc, XPathConstants.NODESET);\n...\n\n\nUnder normal conditions, such as searching for an e-mail address that belongs to the account number 1, the query that this code executes will look like the following:\n\n/accounts/account[acctID='1']/email/text()\n\nHowever, because the query is constructed dynamically by concatenating a constant base query string and a user input string, the query only behaves correctly if acctID does not contain a single-quote character. If an attacker enters the string 1' or '1' = '1 for acctID, then the query becomes the following:\n\n/accounts/account[acctID='1' or '1' = '1']/email/text()\n\nThe addition of the 1' or '1' = '1 condition causes the where clause to always evaluate to true, so the query becomes logically equivalent to the much simpler query:\n\n//email/text()\n\nThis simplification of the query allows the attacker to bypass the requirement that the query only return items owned by the authenticated user; the query now returns all e-mail addresses stored in the document, regardless of their specified owner.\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe root cause of XPath injection vulnerability is the ability of an attacker to change context in the XPath query, causing a value that the programmer intended to be interpreted as data to be interpreted as a command instead.  When an XPath query is constructed, the programmer knows what should be interpreted as part of the command and what should be interpreted as data.\n \nTo prevent an attacker from violating the programmer's expectations, use a whitelist to ensure that user-controlled values used in an XPath query are composed from only the expected set of characters and do not contain any XPath metacharacters given the context in which they are used. If a user-controlled value requires that it contain XPath metacharacters, use an appropriate encoding mechanism to remove their significance within the XPath query.\n\nExample 2\n...\nString acctID = request.getParameter(\"acctID\");\nString query = null;\nif(acctID != null) {\n       Integer iAcctID = -1;\n       try {\n              iAcctID = Integer.parseInt(acctID);\n       }\n       catch (NumberFormatException e) {\n              throw new InvalidParameterException();\n       }\n       StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(\"/accounts/account[acctID='\");\n       sb.append(iAcctID.toString());\n       sb.append(\"']/email/text()\");\n       query = sb.toString();\n}\n\nDocumentBuilderFactory domFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\ndomFactory.setNamespaceAware(true);\nDocumentBuilder builder = domFactory.newDocumentBuilder();\nDocument doc = builder.parse(\"accounts.xml\");\nXPathFactory factory = XPathFactory.newInstance();\nXPath xpath = factory.newXPath();\nXPathExpression expr = xpath.compile(query);\nObject result = expr.evaluate(doc, XPathConstants.NODESET);\n...\n\n\n\nTips\n\n-\n\nReferences\n\nCWE ID 91, Common Weakness Enumeration\n\nCWE ID 643, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA6 Injection Flaws, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2004 - (OWASP 2004)\n\nA2 Injection Flaws, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2007 - (OWASP 2007)\n\nRequirement 6.5.6, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.1 - (PCI 1.1)\n\nRequirement 6.3.1.1, 6.5.2, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.2 - (PCI 1.2)\n\nAPP3510 CAT I, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n\nXPath Injection, Standards Mapping - Web Application Security Consortium 24 + 2 - (WASC 24 + 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"

            "text" : "Explanation\n\nThe program can potentially fail to release a system resource.\n\n    In this case, there are program paths on which the resource allocated in  at line  is not released.\n\n\nResource leaks have at least two common causes:\n\n- Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.\n\n- Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.\n\nMost unreleased resource issues result in general software reliability problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a resource leak, the attacker might be able to launch a denial of service attack by depleting the resource pool.\n\nExample 1: The following method never closes the file handle it opens. The finalize() method for FileInputStream eventually calls close(), but there is no guarantee as to how long it will take before the finalize() method will be invoked. In a busy environment, this can result in the JVM using up all of its file handles.\n\nprivate void processFile(String fName) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException\n{\n  FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(fName);\n  int sz;\n  byte[] byteArray = new byte[BLOCK_SIZE];\n  while ((sz = fis.read(byteArray)) != -1) {\n    processBytes(byteArray, sz);\n  }\n}\n\n\nExample 2: Under normal conditions, the following code executes a database query, processes the results returned by the database, and closes the allocated statement object. But if an exception occurs while executing the SQL or processing the results, the statement object will not be closed. If this happens often enough, the database will run out of available cursors and not be able to execute any more SQL queries.\n\n  Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();\n  ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(CXN_SQL);\n  harvestResults(rs);\n  stmt.close();\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\n1. Never rely on finalize() to reclaim resources. In order for an object's finalize() method to be invoked, the garbage collector must determine that the object is eligible for garbage collection. Because the garbage collector is not required to run unless the JVM is low on memory, there is no guarantee that an object's finalize() method will be invoked in an expedient fashion. When the garbage collector finally does run, it may cause a large number of resources to be reclaimed in a short period of time, which can lead to \"bursty\" performance and lower overall system throughput. This effect becomes more pronounced as the load on the system increases.\n\nFinally, if it is possible for a resource reclamation operation to hang (if it requires communicating over a network to a database, for example), then the thread that is executing the finalize() method will hang. \n\n2. Release resources in a finally block. The code for Example 2 should be rewritten as follows:\n\n  public void execCxnSql(Connection conn) {\n    Statement stmt;\n    try {\n      stmt = conn.createStatement();\n      ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(CXN_SQL);\n      ...\n    }\n    finally {\n      if (stmt != null) {\n        safeClose(stmt);\n      }\n    }\n}\n\npublic static void safeClose(Statement stmt) {\n  if (stmt != null) {\n    try {\n      stmt.close();\n    } catch (SQLException e) {\n      log(e);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nThis solution uses a helper function to log the exceptions that might occur when trying to close the statement. Presumably this helper function will be reused whenever a statement needs to be closed. \n\nAlso, the execCxnSql method does not initialize the stmt object to null. Instead, it checks to ensure that stmt is not null before calling safeClose(). Without the null check, the Java compiler reports that stmt might not be initialized. This choice takes advantage of Java's ability to detect uninitialized variables. If  stmt is initialized to null in a more complex method, cases in which stmt is used without being initialized will not be detected by the compiler. \n\n\nTips\n\n-\n\nReferences\n\nCWE ID 404, Common Weakness Enumeration\n\nCWE ID 404, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA9 Application Denial of Service, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2004 - (OWASP 2004)\n\nRequirement 6.5.9, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.1 - (PCI 1.1)\n\nAPP6080 CAT II, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"

The data is written to an external location, such as the console, file system, or network. \n\n    In this case the data is passed to  in  at line .\n\n\nExample: The following code contains a logging statement that tracks the contents of records added to a database by storing them in a log file. Among other values that are stored, the getPassword() function returns the user-supplied plaintext password associated with the account. \n\npass = getPassword();\n...\ndbmsLog.println(id+\":\"+pass+\":\"+type+\":\"+tstamp);\n\n\nThe code in the example above logs a plaintext password to the filesystem. Although many developers trust the filesystem as a safe storage location for data, it should not be trusted implicitly, particularly when privacy is a concern. \n\nPrivate data can enter a program in a variety of ways:\n\n- Directly from the user in the form of a password or personal information\n\n- Accessed from a database or other data store by the application\n\n- Indirectly from a partner or other third party\n\nSometimes data that is not labeled as private can have a privacy implication in a different context. For example, student identification numbers are usually not considered private because there is no explicit and publicly-available mapping to an individual student's personal information. However, if a school generates identification numbers based on student social security numbers, then the identification numbers should be considered private. \n\nSecurity and privacy concerns often seem to compete with each other. From a security perspective, you should record all important operations so that any anomalous activity can later be identified. However, when private data is involved, this practice can in fact create risk. \n\nAlthough there are many ways in which private data can be handled unsafely, a common risk stems from misplaced trust. Programmers often trust the operating environment in which a program runs, and therefore believe that it is acceptable to store private information on the file system, in the registry, or in other locally-controlled resources. However, even if access to certain resources is restricted, this does not guarantee that the individuals who do have access can be trusted. For example, in 2004, an unscrupulous employee at AOL sold approximately 92 million private customer e-mail addresses to a spammer marketing an offshore gambling web site [1].\n\nIn response to such high-profile exploits, the collection and management of private data is becoming increasingly regulated. Depending on its location, the type of business it conducts, and the nature of any private data it handles, an organization may be required to comply with one or more of the following federal and state regulations:\n\n- Safe Harbor Privacy Framework [3]\n\n- Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (GLBA) [4]\n\n- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) [5]\n\n- California SB-1386 [6]\n\nDespite these regulations, privacy violations continue to occur with alarming frequency. \n\n\nRecommendations\n\nWhen security and privacy demands clash, privacy should usually be given the higher priority. To accomplish this and still maintain required security information, cleanse any private information before it exits the program.\n\nTo enforce good privacy management, develop and strictly adhere to internal privacy guidelines. The guidelines should specifically describe how an application should handle private data. If your organization is regulated by federal or state law, ensure that your privacy guidelines are sufficiently strenuous to meet the legal requirements. Even if your organization is not regulated, you must protect private information or risk losing customer confidence.\n\nThe best policy with respect to private data is to minimize its exposure. Applications, processes, and employees should not be granted access to any private data unless the access is required for the tasks that they are to perform. Just as the principle of least privilege dictates that no operation should be performed with more than the necessary privileges, access to private data should be restricted to the smallest possible group.\n\n\nTips\n\nAs part of any thorough audit for privacy violations, ensure that custom rules have been written to identify all sources of private or otherwise sensitive information entering the program.  Most sources of private data cannot be identified automatically.  Without custom rules, your check for privacy violations is likely to be substantially incomplete.\n\nThe Fortify Java Annotations FortifyPassword, FortifyNotPassword, FortifyPrivate and FortifyNotPrivate can be used to indicate which fields and variables represent passwords and private data.\n\nForitfy RTA adds protection against this category.\n\nReferences\n\nAOL man pleads guilty to selling 92m email addies, The Register, J.

            "text" : "Explanation\n\nIt is never a good idea to hardcode a password. Not only does hardcoding a password allow all of the project's developers to view the password, it also makes fixing the problem extremely difficult. Once the code is in production, the password cannot be changed without patching the software. If the account protected by the password is compromised, the owners of the system will be forced to choose between security and availability.\n\nIn this case a hardcoded password was found in the call to  in  at line .\n\n\nExample: The following code uses a hardcoded password to connect to a database:\n\n...\nDriverManager.getConnection(url, \"scott\", \"tiger\");\n...\n\n\nThis code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to it will have access to the password. Once the program has shipped, there is no going back from the database user \"scott\" with a password of \"tiger\" unless the program is patched. A devious employee with access to this information can use it to break into the system. Even worse, if attackers have access to the bytecode for application, they can use the javap -c command to access the disassembled code, which will contain the values of the passwords used. The result of this operation might look something like the following for the example above:\n\njavap -c ConnMngr.class\n\n22: ldc   #36; //String jdbc:mysql://ixne.com/rxsql\n24: ldc   #38; //String scott\n26: ldc   #17; //String tiger\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nPasswords should never be hardcoded and should generally be obfuscated and managed in an external source. Storing passwords in plaintext anywhere on the system allows anyone with sufficient permissions to read and potentially misuse the password.\n\nSome third party products claim the ability to manage passwords in a more secure way. For example, WebSphere Application Server 4.x uses a simple XOR encryption algorithm for obfuscating values, but be skeptical about such facilities. WebSphere and other application servers offer outdated and relatively weak encryption mechanisms that are insufficient for security-sensitive environments. For a secure solution, the only viable option available today appears to be a proprietary one that you create.\n\n\nTips\n\nAvoid hardcoding passwords in source code and avoid using default passwords. If a hardcoded password is the default, require that it be changed and remove it from the source code.\n\nThe Fortify Java Annotations FortifyPassword and FortifyNotPassword can be used to indicate which fields and variables represent passwords.\n\nReferences\n\nCWE ID 259, Common Weakness Enumeration\n\nCWE ID 259, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA8 Insecure Storage, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2004 - (OWASP 2004)\n\nA8 Insecure Cryptographic Storage, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2007 - (OWASP 2007)\n\nRequirement 3.4, 6.5.8, 8.4, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.1 - (PCI 1.1)\n\nRequirement 3.4, 6.3.1.3, 6.5.8, 8.4, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.2 - (PCI 1.2)\n\nAPP3210.4 CAT II, APP3340 CAT I, APP3350 CAT I, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"

For example, a database error message can reveal that the application is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. Other error messages can reveal more oblique clues about the system. In the example above, the search path could imply information about the type of operating system, the applications installed on the system, and the amount of care that the administrators have put into configuring the program.\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nWrite error messages with security in mind. In production environments, turn off detailed error information in favor of brief messages. Restrict the generation and storage of detailed output that can help administrators and programmers diagnose problems. Be careful, debugging traces can sometimes appear in non-obvious places (embedded in comments in the HTML for an error page, for example).\n\nEven brief error messages that do not reveal stack traces or database dumps can potentially aid an attacker. For example, an \"Access Denied\" message can reveal that a file or user exists on the system.\n\n\nTips\n\nDo not rely on wrapper scripts, corporate IT policy, or quick-thinking system administrators to prevent system information leaks. Write software that is secure on its own.\n\nThis category of vulnerability does not apply to all types of programs. For example, if your application executes on a client machine where system information is already available to an attacker, or if you print system information only to a trusted log file, you can use AuditGuide to filter out this category.\n\nForitfy RTA adds protection against this category.\n\nReferences\n\nCWE ID 497, Common Weakness Enumeration\n\nCWE ID 497, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA6 Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2007 - (OWASP 2007)\n\nRequirement 6.5.6, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.2 - (PCI 1.2)\n\nAPP3620 CAT II, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n\nInformation Leakage, Standards Mapping - Web Application Security Consortium 24 + 2 - (WASC 24 + 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"

Catching an overly broad exception essentially defeats the purpose of Java's typed exceptions, and can become particularly dangerous if the program grows and begins to throw new types of exceptions. The new exception types will not receive any attention.\n\nExample: The following code excerpt handles three types of exceptions in an identical fashion.\n\n  try {\n    doExchange();\n  }\n  catch (IOException e) {\n    logger.error(\"doExchange failed\", e);\n  }\n  catch (InvocationTargetException e) {\n    logger.error(\"doExchange failed\", e);\n  }\n  catch (SQLException e) {\n    logger.error(\"doExchange failed\", e);\n  }\n\n\nAt first blush, it may seem preferable to deal with these exceptions in a single catch block, as follows:\n\n  try {\n    doExchange();\n  }\n  catch (Exception e) {\n    logger.error(\"doExchange failed\", e);\n  }\n\n\nHowever, if doExchange() is modified to throw a new type of exception that should be handled in some different kind of way, the broad catch block will prevent the compiler from pointing out the situation. Further, the new catch block will now also handle exceptions derived from RuntimeException such as ClassCastException, and NullPointerException, which is not the programmer's intent.\n\nRecommendations\n\nDo not catch broad exception classes like Exception, Throwable, Error, or &lt;RuntimeException&gt; except at the very top level of the program or thread.\n\nTips\n\nFortify will not flag an overly broad catch block if the catch block in question immediately throws a new exception.\n\nReferences\n\nCWE ID 396, Common Weakness Enumeration\n\nCWE ID 396, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA7 Improper Error Handling, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2004 - (OWASP 2004)\n\nA6 Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2007 - (OWASP 2007)\n\nRequirement 6.5.7, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.1 - (PCI 1.1)\n\nRequirement 6.3.1.2, 6.5.6, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.2 - (PCI 1.2)\n\nAPP3120 CAT II, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"

An attacker can specify the identifier used to access a system resource. \n\nFor example, an attacker might be able to specify a port number to be used to connect to a network resource. \n\n2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.\n\nFor example, the program may give the attacker the ability to transmit sensitive information to a third-party server. \n\n\nIn this case, the attacker can specify the value that enters the program at  in  at line , and this value is used to access a system resource at  in  at line .\n\n\nNote: Resource injection that involves resources stored on the filesystem goes by the name path manipulation and is reported in separate category. See the path manipulation description for further details of this vulnerability. \n\nExample: The following code uses a port number read from an HTTP request to create a socket.  \n\nString remotePort = request.getParameter(\"remotePort\");\n...\nServerSocket srvr = new ServerSocket(remotePort);\nSocket skt = srvr.accept(); \n...\n\n\nThe kind of resource affected by user input indicates the kind of content that may be dangerous.  For example, data containing special characters like period, slash, and backslash are risky when used in methods that interact with the file system. Similarly, data that contains URLs and URIs is risky for functions that create remote connections.\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe best way to prevent resource injection is with a level of indirection: create a list of legitimate resource names that a user is allowed to specify, and only allow the user to select from the list. With this approach the input provided by the user is never used directly to specify the resource name. \n\nIn some situations this approach is impractical because the set of legitimate resource names is too large or too hard to keep track of. Programmers often resort to blacklisting in these situations. Blacklisting selectively rejects or escapes potentially dangerous characters before using the input. However, any such list of unsafe characters is likely to be incomplete and will almost certainly become out of date. A better approach is to create a white list of characters that are allowed to appear in the resource name and accept input composed exclusively of characters in the approved set.\n\n\nTips\n\nIf the program is performing input validation, satisfy yourself that the validation is correct, and use Fortify Rules Builder to create a cleanse rule for the validation routine.\n\n\nIt is notoriously difficult to correctly implement a blacklist. If the validation logic relies on blacklisting, be skeptical. Consider different types of input encoding and different sets of meta-characters that might have special meaning when interpreted by different operating systems, databases, or other resources. Determine whether or not the blacklist can be updated easily, correctly, and completely if these requirements ever change.\n\n\nReferences\n\nExploiting Software, Addison-Wesley, G. Hoglund, G.

Java's exception mechanism is set up to make it easy for callers to anticipate what can go wrong and write code to handle each specific exceptional circumstance. Declaring that a method throws a generic form of exception defeats this system.\n\nExample: The following method throws three types of exceptions.\n\npublic void doExchange()\n  throws IOException, InvocationTargetException,\n         SQLException {\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nWhile it might seem tidier to write \n\npublic void doExchange()\n  throws Exception {\n  ...\n}\n\n\ndoing so hampers the caller's ability to understand and handle the exceptions that occur. Further, if a later revision of doExchange() introduces a new type of exception that should be treated differently than previous exceptions, there is no easy way to enforce this requirement.\n\nRecommendations\n\nDo not declare methods to throw Exception or Throwable. If the exceptions thrown by a method are not recoverable or should not generally be caught by the caller, consider throwing unchecked exceptions rather than checked exceptions. This can be accomplished by implementing exception classes that extend RuntimeException or Error instead of Exception, or add a try/catch wrapper in your method to convert checked exceptions to unchecked exceptions.\n\nTips\n\n-\n\nReferences\n\nCWE ID 397, Common Weakness Enumeration\n\nCWE ID 397, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA7 Improper Error Handling, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2004 - (OWASP 2004)\n\nA6 Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2007 - (OWASP 2007)\n\nRequirement 6.5.7, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.1 - (PCI 1.1)\n\nRequirement 6.3.1.2, 6.5.6, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.2 - (PCI 1.2)\n\nAPP3120 CAT II, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"

            "text" : "Explanation\n\nCommand injection vulnerabilities take two forms:\n\n- An attacker can change the command that the program executes: the attacker explicitly controls what the command is.\n\n- An attacker can change the environment in which the command executes: the attacker implicitly controls what the command means.\n\nIn this case we are primarily concerned with the first scenario, the possibility that an attacker may be able to control the command that is executed. Command injection vulnerabilities of this type occur when:\n\n1. Data enters the application from an untrusted source.\n\nIn this case the data enters at  in  at line .\n\n2. The data is used as or as part of a string representing a command that is executed by the application. \n\nIn this case the command is executed by  in  at line .\n\n3. By executing the command, the application gives an attacker a privilege or capability that the attacker would not otherwise have. \n\nExample 1: The following code from a system utility uses the system property APPHOME to determine the directory in which it is installed and then executes an initialization script based on a relative path from the specified directory. \n\n\t...\n\tString home = System.getProperty(\"APPHOME\");\n\tString cmd = home + INITCMD; \n\tjava.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);\n\t...\n\n\nThe code in Example 1 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the elevated privilege of the application by modifying the system property APPHOME to point to a different path containing a malicious version of INITCMD. Because the program does not validate the value read from the environment, if an attacker can control the value of the system property APPHOME, then they can fool the application into running malicious code and take control of the system.\n\nExample 2: The following code is from an administrative web application designed allow users to kick off a backup of an Oracle database using a batch-file wrapper around the rman utility and then run a cleanup.bat script to delete some temporary files. The script rmanDB.bat accepts a single command line parameter, which specifies what type of backup to perform. Because access to the database is restricted, the application runs the backup as a privileged user. \n\n...\nString btype = request.getParameter(\"backuptype\");\nString cmd = new String(\"cmd.exe /K \n\\\"c:\\\\util\\\\rmanDB.bat \"+btype+\"&amp;&amp;c:\\\\utl\\\\cleanup.bat\\\"\")\nSystem.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);\n...\n\n\nThe problem here is that the program does not do any validation on the backuptype parameter read from the user. Typically the Runtime.exec() function will not execute multiple commands, but in this case the program first runs the cmd.exe shell in order to run multiple commands with a single call to Runtime.exec(). Once the shell is invoked, it will happily execute multiple commands separated by two ampersands. If an attacker passes a string of the form \"&amp;&amp; del c:\\\\dbms\\\\*.*\", then the application will execute this command along with the others specified by the program. Because of the nature of the application, it runs with the privileges necessary to interact with the database, which means whatever command the attacker injects will run with those privileges as well. \n\nExample 3: The following code is from a web application that allows users access to an interface through which they can update their password on the system. Part of the process for updating passwords in certain network environments is to run a make command in the /var/yp directory, the code for which is shown below. \n\n...\nSystem.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"make\");\n...\n\n\nThe problem here is that the program does not specify an absolute path for make and fails to clean its environment prior to executing the call to Runtime.exec(). If an attacker can modify the $PATH variable to point to a malicious binary called make and cause the program to be executed in their environment, then the malicious binary will be loaded instead of the one intended. Because of the nature of the application, it runs with the privileges necessary to perform system operations, which means the attacker's make will now be run with these privileges, possibly giving the attacker complete control of the system.\n\nRecommendations\n\nDo not allow users to have direct control over the commands executed by the program. In cases where user input must affect the command to be run, use the input only to make a selection from a predetermined set of safe commands. If the input appears to be malicious, the value passed to the command execution function should either default to some safe selection from this set or the program should decline to execute any command at all. \n\nIn cases where user input must be used as an argument to a command executed by the program, this approach often becomes impractical because the set of legitimate argument values is too large or too hard to keep track of. Developers often fall back on blacklisting in these situations. Blacklisting selectively rejects or escapes potentially dangerous characters before using the input. Any list of unsafe characters is likely to be incomplete and will be heavily dependant on the system where the commands are executed. A better approach is to create a white list of characters that are allowed to appear in the input and accept input composed exclusively of characters in the approved set.\n\nAn attacker can indirectly control commands executed by a program by modifying the environment in which they are executed. The environment should not be trusted and precautions should be taken to prevent an attacker from using some manipulation of the environment to perform an attack. Whenever possible, commands should be controlled by the application and executed using an absolute path. In cases where the path is not known at compile time, such as for cross-platform applications, an absolute path should be constructed from trusted values during execution. Command values and paths read from configuration files or the environment should be sanity-checked against a set of invariants that define valid values. \n\nOther checks can sometimes be performed to detect if these sources may have been tampered with. For example, if a configuration file is world-writable, the program might refuse to run. In cases where information about the binary to be executed is known in advance, the program may perform checks to verify the identity of the binary. If a binary should always be owned by a particular user or have a particular set of access permissions assigned to it, these properties can be verified programmatically before the binary is executed.\n\nAlthough it may be impossible to completely protect a program from an imaginative attacker bent on controlling the commands the program executes, be sure to apply the principle of least privilege wherever the program executes an external command: do not hold privileges that are not essential to the execution of the command.\n\nTips\n\n-\n\nReferences\n\nCWE ID 77, 78, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA6 Injection Flaws, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2004 - (OWASP 2004)\n\nA2 Injection Flaws, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2007 - (OWASP 2007)\n\nRequirement 6.5.6, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.1 - (PCI 1.1)\n\nRequirement 6.3.1.1, 6.5.2, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.2 - (PCI 1.2)\n\nAPP3510 CAT I, APP3570 CAT I, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n\nOS Commanding, Standards Mapping - Web Application Security Consortium 24 + 2 - (WASC 24 + 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"

            "text" : "Explanation\n\nIt is never a good idea to hardcode a password. Not only does hardcoding a password allow all of the project's developers to view the password, it also makes fixing the problem extremely difficult. Once the code is in production, the password cannot be changed without patching the software. If the account protected by the password is compromised, the owners of the system will be forced to choose between security and availability.\n\nIn this case a hardcoded password was found in the call to  in  at line .\n\n\nExample: The following code uses a hardcoded password to connect to a database:\n\n...\nDriverManager.getConnection(url, \"scott\", \"tiger\");\n...\n\n\nThis code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to it will have access to the password. Once the program has shipped, there is no going back from the database user \"scott\" with a password of \"tiger\" unless the program is patched. A devious employee with access to this information can use it to break into the system. Even worse, if attackers have access to the bytecode for application, they can use the javap -c command to access the disassembled code, which will contain the values of the passwords used. The result of this operation might look something like the following for the example above:\n\njavap -c ConnMngr.class\n\n22: ldc   #36; //String jdbc:mysql://ixne.com/rxsql\n24: ldc   #38; //String scott\n26: ldc   #17; //String tiger\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nPasswords should never be hardcoded and should generally be obfuscated and managed in an external source. Storing passwords in plaintext anywhere on the system allows anyone with sufficient permissions to read and potentially misuse the password.\n\nSome third party products claim the ability to manage passwords in a more secure way. For example, WebSphere Application Server 4.x uses a simple XOR encryption algorithm for obfuscating values, but be skeptical about such facilities. WebSphere and other application servers offer outdated and relatively weak encryption mechanisms that are insufficient for security-sensitive environments. For a secure solution, the only viable option available today appears to be a proprietary one that you create.\n\n\nTips\n\nAvoid hardcoding passwords in source code and avoid using default passwords. If a hardcoded password is the default, require that it be changed and remove it from the source code.\n\nThe Fortify Java Annotations FortifyPassword and FortifyNotPassword can be used to indicate which fields and variables represent passwords.\n\nReferences\n\nCWE ID 259, Common Weakness Enumeration\n\nCWE ID 259, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA8 Insecure Storage, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2004 - (OWASP 2004)\n\nA8 Insecure Cryptographic Storage, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2007 - (OWASP 2007)\n\nRequirement 3.4, 6.5.8, 8.4, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.1 - (PCI 1.1)\n\nRequirement 3.4, 6.3.1.3, 6.5.8, 8.4, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.2 - (PCI 1.2)\n\nAPP3210.4 CAT II, APP3340 CAT I, APP3350 CAT I, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"

            "text" : "Explanation\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source. In the case of Reflected XSS, the untrusted source is typically a web request, while in the case of Persisted (also known as Stored) XSS it is typically a database or other back-end datastore.\n\n\nIn this case the data enters at  in  at line . \n\n2. The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated for malicious code. \n\nIn this case the data is sent at  in  at line .\n\nThe malicious content sent to the web browser often takes the form of a segment of JavaScript, but may also include HTML, Flash or any other type of code that the browser may execute. The variety of attacks based on XSS is almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting private data like cookies or other session information to the attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.\n\nExample 1: The following JSP code segment reads an employee ID, eid, from an HTTP request and displays it to the user. \n\n&lt;% String eid = request.getParameter(\"eid\"); %&gt; \n...\nEmployee ID: &lt;%= eid %&gt;\n\n\nThe code in this example operates correctly if eid contains only standard alphanumeric text. If eid has a value that includes meta-characters or source code, then the code will be executed by the web browser as it displays the HTTP response.\n\nInitially this might not appear to be much of a vulnerability. After all, why would someone enter a URL that causes malicious code to run on their own computer? The real danger is that an attacker will create the malicious URL, then use e-mail or social engineering tricks to lure victims into visiting a link to the URL. When victims click the link, they unwittingly reflect the malicious content through the vulnerable web application back to their own computers. This mechanism of exploiting vulnerable web applications is known as Reflected XSS.\n\nExample 2: The following JSP code segment queries a database for an employee with a given ID and prints the corresponding employee's name.\n\n \n&lt;%... \n Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();\n ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(\"select * from emp where id=\"+eid);\n if (rs != null) {\n  rs.next(); \n  String name = rs.getString(\"name\");\n%&gt;\n\nEmployee Name: &lt;%= name %&gt;\n\n\nAs in Example 1, this code functions correctly when the values of name are well-behaved, but it does nothing to prevent exploits if they are not. Again, this code can appear less dangerous because the value of name is read from a database, whose contents are apparently managed by the application. However, if the value of name originates from user-supplied data, then the database can be a conduit for malicious content. Without proper input validation on all data stored in the database, an attacker can execute malicious commands in the user's web browser. This type of exploit, known as Persistent (or Stored) XSS, is particularly insidious because the indirection caused by the data store makes it more difficult to identify the threat and increases the possibility that the attack will affect multiple users. XSS got its start in this form with web sites that offered a \"guestbook\" to visitors. Attackers would include JavaScript in their guestbook entries, and all subsequent visitors to the guestbook page would execute the malicious code.\n\nAs the examples demonstrate, XSS vulnerabilities are caused by code that includes unvalidated data in an HTTP response. There are three vectors by which an XSS attack can reach a victim:\n\n- As in Example 1, data is read directly from the HTTP request and reflected back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a user to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the user and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to victims. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces victims to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the user, the content is executed and proceeds to transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the user's machine to the attacker or perform other nefarious activities.\n\n- As in Example 2, the application stores dangerous data in a database or other trusted data store. The dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. Persistent XSS exploits occur when an attacker injects dangerous content into a data store that is later read and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user.\n\n- A source outside the application stores dangerous data in a database or other data store, and the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application as trusted data and included in dynamic content.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe solution to XSS is to ensure that validation occurs in the correct places and checks for the correct properties.\n\nSince XSS vulnerabilities occur when an application includes malicious data in its output, one logical approach is to validate data immediately before it leaves the application. However, because web applications often have complex and intricate code for generating dynamic content, this method is prone to errors of omission (missing validation). An effective way to mitigate this risk is to also perform input validation for XSS.\n\nWeb applications must validate their input to prevent other vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, so augmenting an application's existing input validation mechanism to include checks for XSS is generally relatively easy. Despite its value, input validation for XSS does not take the place of rigorous output validation. An application may accept input through a shared data store or other trusted source, and that data store may accept input from a source that does not perform adequate input validation. Therefore, the application cannot implicitly rely on the safety of this or any other data. This means the best way to prevent XSS vulnerabilities is to validate everything that enters the application or leaves the application destined for the user. \n\nThe most secure approach to validation for XSS is to create a whitelist of safe characters that are allowed to appear in HTTP content and accept input composed exclusively of characters in the approved set. For example, a valid username might only include alpha-numeric characters or a phone number might only include digits 0-9. However, this solution is often infeasible in web applications because many characters that have special meaning to the browser should still be considered valid input once they are encoded, such as a web design bulletin board that must accept HTML fragments from its users. \n\nA more flexible, but less secure approach is known as blacklisting, which selectively rejects or escapes potentially dangerous characters before using the input. In order to form such a list, you first need to understand the set of characters that hold special meaning for web browsers. Although the HTML standard defines what characters have special meaning, many web browsers try to correct common mistakes in HTML and may treat other characters as special in certain contexts. The CERT(R) Coordination Center at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University provides the following details about special characters in various contexts [1]:\n\nIn the content of a block-level element (in the middle of a paragraph of text):\n\n- \"&lt;\" is special because it introduces a tag.\n\n- \"&amp;\" is special because it introduces a character entity.\n\n- \"&gt;\" is special because some browsers treat it as special, on the assumption that the author of the page intended to include an opening \"&lt;\", but omitted it in error.\n\nThe following principles apply to attribute values:\n\n- In attribute values enclosed with double quotes, the double quotes are special because they mark the end of the attribute value.\n\n- In attribute values enclosed with single quote, the single quotes are special because they mark the end of the attribute value.\n\n- In attribute values without any quotes, white-space characters, such as space and tab, are special.\n\n- \"&amp;\" is special when used with certain attributes, because it introduces a character entity. \n\nIn URLs, for example, a search engine might provide a link within the results page that the user can click to re-run the search. This can be implemented by encoding the search query inside the URL, which introduces additional special characters:\n\n- Space, tab, and new line are special because they mark the end of the URL.\n\n- \"&amp;\" is special because it either introduces a character entity or separates CGI parameters.\n\n- Non-ASCII characters (that is, everything above 128 in the ISO-8859-1 encoding) are not allowed in URLs, so they are considered to be special in this context.\n\n- The \"%\" symbol must be filtered from input anywhere parameters encoded with HTTP escape sequences are decoded by server-side code. For example, \"%\" must be filtered if input such as \"%68%65%6C%6C%6F\" becomes \"hello\" when it appears on the web page in question.\n\n\nWithin the body of a &lt;SCRIPT&gt; &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;:\n\n- The semicolon, parenthesis, curly braces, and new line should be filtered in situations where text could be inserted directly into a pre-existing script tag. \n\nServer-side scripts:\n\n- Server-side scripts that convert any exclamation characters (!) in input to double-quote characters (\") on output might require additional filtering. \n\nOther possibilities:\n\n- If an attacker submits a request in UTF-7, the special character '&lt;' appears as '+ADw-' and may bypass filtering. If the output is included in a page that does not explicitly specify an encoding format, then some browsers try to intelligently identify the encoding based on the content (in this case, UTF-7).\n\nOnce you identify the correct points in an application to perform validation for XSS attacks and what special characters the validation should consider, the next challenge is to identify how your validation handles special characters. If special characters are not considered valid input to the application, then you can reject any input that contains special characters as invalid. A second option in this situation is to remove special characters with filtering. However, filtering has the side effect of changing any visual representation of the filtered content and may be unacceptable in circumstances where the integrity of the input must be preserved for display.\n\nIf input containing special characters must be accepted and displayed accurately, validation must encode any special characters to remove their significance. A complete list of ISO 8859-1 encoded values for special characters is provided as part of the official HTML specification [2].\n\nMany application servers attempt to limit an application's exposure to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities by providing implementations for the functions responsible for setting certain specific HTTP response content that perform validation for the characters essential to a cross-site scripting attack. Do not rely on the server running your application to make it secure. When an application is developed there are no guarantees about what application servers it will run on during its lifetime. As standards and known exploits evolve, there are no guarantees that application servers will also stay in sync.\n\nTips\n\nIn Fortify Source Code Analysis Suite, the database is treated as a source of untrusted data for XSS vulnerabilities.

            "text" : "Explanation\n\nJust about every serious attack on a software system begins with the violation of a programmer's assumptions. After the attack, the programmer's assumptions seem flimsy and poorly founded, but before an attack many programmers would defend their assumptions well past the end of their lunch break.\n\nTwo dubious assumptions that are easy to spot in code are \"this method call can never fail\" and \"it doesn't matter if this call fails\". When a programmer ignores an exception, they implicitly state that they are operating under one of these assumptions.\n\nExample 1: The following code excerpt ignores a rarely-thrown exception from doExchange().\n\ntry {\n  doExchange();\n}\ncatch (RareException e) {\n  // this can never happen\n}\n\n\nIf a RareException were to ever be thrown, the program would continue to execute as though nothing unusual had occurred. The program records no evidence indicating the special situation, potentially frustrating any later attempt to explain the program's behavior.\n\nRecommendations\n\nAt a minimum, log the fact that the exception was thrown so that it will be possible to come back later and make sense of the resulting program behavior. Better yet, abort the current operation. If the exception is being ignored because the caller cannot properly handle it but the context makes it inconvenient or impossible for the caller to declare that it throws the exception itself, consider throwing a RuntimeException or an Error, both of which are unchecked exceptions. As of JDK 1.4, RuntimeException has a constructor that makes it easy to wrap another exception. \n\nExample 2: The code in Example 1 could be rewritten in the following way:\n\ntry {\n  doExchange();\n}\ncatch (RareException e) {\n  throw RuntimeException(\"This can never happen\", e);\n}\n\n\nTips\n\nThere are rare types of exceptions that can be discarded in some contexts. For instance, <code>Thread.sleep()</code> throws <code>InterruptedException</code>, and in many situations the program should behave the same way whether or not it was awoken prematurely.\n\n<pre>\n  try {\n    Thread.sleep(1000);\n  }\n  catch (InterruptedException e){\n    // The thread has been woken up prematurely, but its\n    // behavior should be the same either way.\n  }\n</pre>\n\nReferences\n\nCWE ID 391, Common Weakness Enumeration\n\nCWE ID 391, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA7 Improper Error Handling, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2004 - (OWASP 2004)\n\nA6 Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2007 - (OWASP 2007)\n\nRequirement 6.5.7, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.1 - (PCI 1.1)\n\nRequirement 6.3.1.2, 6.5.6, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.2 - (PCI 1.2)\n\nAPP3120 CAT II, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"

            "text" : "Explanation\n\nIt is not uncommon for Java programmers to misunderstand read() and related methods that are part of many java.io classes. Most errors and unusual events in Java result in an exception being thrown. (This is one of the advantages that Java has over languages like C: Exceptions make it easier for programmers to think about what can go wrong.) But the stream and reader classes do not consider it unusual or exceptional if only a small amount of data becomes available. These classes simply add the small amount of data to the return buffer, and set the return value to the number of bytes or characters read. There is no guarantee that the amount of data returned is equal to the amount of data requested.\n\nThis behavior makes it important for programmers to examine the return value from read() and other IO methods to ensure that they receive the amount of data they expect.\n\n\nIn this case the value of  is unchecked in  at line .\n\n\nExample: The following code loops through a set of users, reading a private data file for each user. The programmer assumes that the files are always exactly 1 kilobyte in size and therefore ignores the return value from read(). If an attacker can create a smaller file, the program will recycle the remainder of the data from the previous user and handle it as though it belongs to the attacker.\n\nFileInputStream fis;\nbyte[] byteArray = new byte[1024];\nfor (Iterator i=users.iterator(); i.hasNext();) {\n    String userName = (String) i.next();\n    String pFileName = PFILE_ROOT + \"/\" + userName;\n    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(pFileName);   \n    fis.read(byteArray); // the file is always 1k bytes\n    fis.close();\n    processPFile(userName, byteArray);\n}\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\n\n  FileInputStream fis;\n  byte[] byteArray = new byte[1024];\n  for (Iterator i=users.iterator(); i.hasNext();) {\n    String userName = (String) i.next();\n    String pFileName = PFILE_ROOT + \"/\" + userName;\n    fis = new FileInputStream(pFileName);\n    int bRead = 0;\n    while (bRead &lt; 1024) {\n        int rd = fis.read(byteArray, bRead, 1024 - bRead); \n        if (rd == -1) {\n          throw new IOException(\"file is unusually small\");\n        }\n        bRead += rd;\n    }\n    // could add check to see if file is too large here\n    fis.close();\n    processPFile(userName, byteArray);\n  }\n\n\nNote: Because the fix for this problem is relatively complicated, you might be tempted to use a simpler approach, such as checking the size of the file before you begin reading. Such an approach would render the application vulnerable to a file system race condition, whereby an attacker could replace a well-formed file with a malicious file between the file size check and the call to read data from the file. \n\n\nTips\n\nWatch out for programmers who want to explain away this type of issue by saying \"that can never happen because ...\".  Chances are good that they have developed their intuition about the way the system works by using their development workstation. If your software will eventually run under different operating systems, operating system versions, hardware configurations, or runtime environments, their intuition may not apply.\n\nReferences\n\nCWE ID 252, Common Weakness Enumeration\n\nCWE ID 252, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA7 Improper Error Handling, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2004 - (OWASP 2004)\n\nA6 Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2007 - (OWASP 2007)\n\nRequirement 6.5.7, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.1 - (PCI 1.1)\n\nRequirement 6.3.1.2, 6.5.6, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.2 - (PCI 1.2)\n\nAPP3120 CAT II, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"

An effective way to mitigate this risk is to also perform input validation for XSS.\n\nWeb applications must validate their input to prevent other vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, so augmenting an application's existing input validation mechanism to include checks for XSS is generally relatively easy. Despite its value, input validation for XSS does not take the place of rigorous output validation. An application may accept input through a shared data store or other trusted source, and that data store may accept input from a source that does not perform adequate input validation. Therefore, the application cannot implicitly rely on the safety of this or any other data. This means the best way to prevent XSS vulnerabilities is to validate everything that enters the application or leaves the application destined for the user. \n\nThe most secure approach to validation for XSS is to create a whitelist of safe characters that are allowed to appear in HTTP content and accept input composed exclusively of characters in the approved set. For example, a valid username might only include alpha-numeric characters or a phone number might only include digits 0-9. However, this solution is often infeasible in web applications because many characters that have special meaning to the browser should still be considered valid input once they are encoded, such as a web design bulletin board that must accept HTML fragments from its users. \n\nA more flexible, but less secure approach is known as blacklisting, which selectively rejects or escapes potentially dangerous characters before using the input. In order to form such a list, you first need to understand the set of characters that hold special meaning for web browsers. Although the HTML standard defines what characters have special meaning, many web browsers try to correct common mistakes in HTML and may treat other characters as special in certain contexts. The CERT(R) Coordination Center at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University provides the following details about special characters in various contexts [1]:\n\nIn the content of a block-level element (in the middle of a paragraph of text):\n\n- \"&lt;\" is special because it introduces a tag.\n\n- \"&amp;\" is special because it introduces a character entity.\n\n- \"&gt;\" is special because some browsers treat it as special, on the assumption that the author of the page intended to include an opening \"&lt;\", but omitted it in error.\n\nThe following principles apply to attribute values:\n\n- In attribute values enclosed with double quotes, the double quotes are special because they mark the end of the attribute value.\n\n- In attribute values enclosed with single quote, the single quotes are special because they mark the end of the attribute value.\n\n- In attribute values without any quotes, white-space characters, such as space and tab, are special.\n\n- \"&amp;\" is special when used with certain attributes, because it introduces a character entity. \n\nIn URLs, for example, a search engine might provide a link within the results page that the user can click to re-run the search. This can be implemented by encoding the search query inside the URL, which introduces additional special characters:\n\n- Space, tab, and new line are special because they mark the end of the URL.\n\n- \"&amp;\" is special because it either introduces a character entity or separates CGI parameters.\n\n- Non-ASCII characters (that is, everything above 128 in the ISO-8859-1 encoding) are not allowed in URLs, so they are considered to be special in this context.\n\n- The \"%\" symbol must be filtered from input anywhere parameters encoded with HTTP escape sequences are decoded by server-side code. For example, \"%\" must be filtered if input such as \"%68%65%6C%6C%6F\" becomes \"hello\" when it appears on the web page in question.\n\n\nWithin the body of a &lt;SCRIPT&gt; &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;:\n\n- The semicolon, parenthesis, curly braces, and new line should be filtered in situations where text could be inserted directly into a pre-existing script tag. \n\nServer-side scripts:\n\n- Server-side scripts that convert any exclamation characters (!) in input to double-quote characters (\") on output might require additional filtering. \n\nOther possibilities:\n\n- If an attacker submits a request in UTF-7, the special character '&lt;' appears as '+ADw-' and may bypass filtering. If the output is included in a page that does not explicitly specify an encoding format, then some browsers try to intelligently identify the encoding based on the content (in this case, UTF-7).\n\nOnce you identify the correct points in an application to perform validation for XSS attacks and what special characters the validation should consider, the next challenge is to identify how your validation handles special characters. If special characters are not considered valid input to the application, then you can reject any input that contains special characters as invalid. A second option in this situation is to remove special characters with filtering. However, filtering has the side effect of changing any visual representation of the filtered content and may be unacceptable in circumstances where the integrity of the input must be preserved for display.\n\nIf input containing special characters must be accepted and displayed accurately, validation must encode any special characters to remove their significance. A complete list of ISO 8859-1 encoded values for special characters is provided as part of the official HTML specification [2].\n\nMany application servers attempt to limit an application's exposure to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities by providing implementations for the functions responsible for setting certain specific HTTP response content that perform validation for the characters essential to a cross-site scripting attack. Do not rely on the server running your application to make it secure. When an application is developed there are no guarantees about what application servers it will run on during its lifetime. As standards and known exploits evolve, there are no guarantees that application servers will also stay in sync.\n\nTips\n\nIn Fortify Source Code Analysis Suite, the database is treated as a source of untrusted data for XSS vulnerabilities.

            "text" : "Explanation\n\nIt is never a good idea to hardcode a password. Not only does hardcoding a password allow all of the project's developers to view the password, it also makes fixing the problem extremely difficult. Once the code is in production, the password cannot be changed without patching the software. If the account protected by the password is compromised, the owners of the system will be forced to choose between security and availability.\n\nIn this case a hardcoded password was found in the call to  in  at line .\n\n\nExample: The following code uses a hardcoded password to connect to a database:\n\n...\nDriverManager.getConnection(url, \"scott\", \"tiger\");\n...\n\n\nThis code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to it will have access to the password. Once the program has shipped, there is no going back from the database user \"scott\" with a password of \"tiger\" unless the program is patched. A devious employee with access to this information can use it to break into the system. Even worse, if attackers have access to the bytecode for application, they can use the javap -c command to access the disassembled code, which will contain the values of the passwords used. The result of this operation might look something like the following for the example above:\n\njavap -c ConnMngr.class\n\n22: ldc   #36; //String jdbc:mysql://ixne.com/rxsql\n24: ldc   #38; //String scott\n26: ldc   #17; //String tiger\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nPasswords should never be hardcoded and should generally be obfuscated and managed in an external source. Storing passwords in plaintext anywhere on the system allows anyone with sufficient permissions to read and potentially misuse the password.\n\nSome third party products claim the ability to manage passwords in a more secure way. For example, WebSphere Application Server 4.x uses a simple XOR encryption algorithm for obfuscating values, but be skeptical about such facilities. WebSphere and other application servers offer outdated and relatively weak encryption mechanisms that are insufficient for security-sensitive environments. For a secure solution, the only viable option available today appears to be a proprietary one that you create.\n\n\nTips\n\nAvoid hardcoding passwords in source code and avoid using default passwords. If a hardcoded password is the default, require that it be changed and remove it from the source code.\n\nThe Fortify Java Annotations FortifyPassword and FortifyNotPassword can be used to indicate which fields and variables represent passwords.\n\nReferences\n\nCWE ID 259, Common Weakness Enumeration\n\nCWE ID 259, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA8 Insecure Storage, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2004 - (OWASP 2004)\n\nA8 Insecure Cryptographic Storage, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2007 - (OWASP 2007)\n\nRequirement 3.4, 6.5.8, 8.4, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.1 - (PCI 1.1)\n\nRequirement 3.4, 6.3.1.3, 6.5.8, 8.4, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.2 - (PCI 1.2)\n\nAPP3210.4 CAT II, APP3340 CAT I, APP3350 CAT I, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"

Encryption algorithms rely on key size as one of the primary mechanism to ensure cryptographic strength. Cryptographic strength is often measured by the time and computational power needed to generate a valid key. Advances in computing power have made it possible to obtain small encryption keys in a reasonable amount of time. For example, the 56-bit key used in DES posed a significant computational hurdle in the 1970's when the algorithm was first developed, but today DES can be cracked in less than a day using commonly available equipment.\n      \n\nRecommendations\n\nUse strong encryption algorithms with large key sizes to protect sensitive data.

Data enters a program from an untrusted source.\n\nIn this case Fortify could not determine that the source of the data is trusted.\n\n2. The data is used to dynamically construct a SQL query. \n\n\nIn this case the data is passed to  in  at line .\n\n\nExample 1: The following code dynamically constructs and executes a SQL query that searches for items matching a specified name. The query restricts the items displayed to those where the owner matches the user name of the currently-authenticated user. \n\n...\n\tString userName = ctx.getAuthenticatedUserName();\n\tString itemName = request.getParameter(\"itemName\");\n\tString query = \"SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = '\" \n\t\t\t\t+ userName + \"' AND itemname = '\"  \n\t\t\t\t+ itemName + \"'\";\n\tResultSet rs = stmt.execute(query);\n\t...\n\n\nThe query that this code intends to execute follows:\n\n\tSELECT * FROM items\n\tWHERE owner = &lt;userName&gt;\n\tAND itemname = &lt;itemName&gt;;\n\n\nHowever, because the query is constructed dynamically by concatenating a constant base query string and a user input string, the query only behaves correctly if itemName does not contain a single-quote character. If an attacker with the user name wiley enters the string \"name' OR 'a'='a\" for itemName, then the query becomes the following:\n\n\tSELECT * FROM items\n\tWHERE owner = 'wiley'\n\tAND itemname = 'name' OR 'a'='a';\n\n\nThe addition of the OR 'a'='a' condition causes the where clause to always evaluate to true, so the query becomes logically equivalent to the much simpler query:\n\n\tSELECT * FROM items;\n\n\nThis simplification of the query allows the attacker to bypass the requirement that the query only return items owned by the authenticated user; the query now returns all entries stored in the items table, regardless of their specified owner.\n\nExample 2: This example examines the effects of a different malicious value passed to the query constructed and executed in Example 1. If an attacker with the user name wiley enters the string \"name'; DELETE FROM items; --\" for itemName, then the query becomes the following two queries:\n\n\tSELECT * FROM items \n\tWHERE owner = 'wiley'\n\tAND itemname = 'name';\n\n\tDELETE FROM items;\n\n\t--'\n\n\nMany database servers, including Microsoft(R) SQL Server 2000, allow multiple SQL statements separated by semicolons to be executed at once. While this attack string results in an error on Oracle and other database servers that do not allow the batch-execution of statements separated by semicolons, on databases that do allow batch execution, this type of attack allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands against the database.  \n\nNotice the trailing pair of hyphens (--), which specifies to most database servers that the remainder of the statement is to be treated as a comment and not executed [4]. In this case the comment character serves to remove the trailing single-quote left over from the modified query. On a database where comments are not allowed to be used in this way, the general attack could still be made effective using a trick similar to the one used in Example 1. If an attacker enters the string \"name'); DELETE FROM items; SELECT * FROM items WHERE 'a'='a\", the following three valid statements will be created: \n\n\tSELECT * FROM items \n\tWHERE owner = 'wiley'\n\tAND itemname = 'name';\n\n\tDELETE FROM items;\n\n\tSELECT * FROM items WHERE 'a'='a';\n\n\nOne traditional approach to preventing SQL injection attacks is to handle them as an input validation problem and either accept only characters from a whitelist of safe values or identify and escape a blacklist of potentially malicious values. Whitelisting can be a very effective means of enforcing strict input validation rules, but parameterized SQL statements require less maintenance and can offer more guarantees with respect to security. As is almost always the case, blacklisting is riddled with loopholes that make it ineffective at preventing SQL injection attacks. For example, attackers can: \n\n- Target fields that are not quoted\n\n- Find ways to bypass the need for certain escaped meta-characters\n\n- Use stored procedures to hide the injected meta-characters\n\nManually escaping characters in input to SQL queries can help, but it will not make your application secure from SQL injection attacks. \n\nAnother solution commonly proposed for dealing with SQL injection attacks is to use stored procedures. Although stored procedures prevent some types of SQL injection attacks, they fail to protect against many others. Stored procedures typically help prevent SQL injection attacks by limiting the types of statements that can be passed to their parameters. However, there are many ways around the limitations and many interesting statements that can still be passed to stored procedures. Again, stored procedures can prevent some exploits, but they will not make your application secure against SQL injection attacks. \n\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe root cause of a SQL injection vulnerability is the ability of an attacker to change context in the SQL query, causing a value that the programmer intended to be interpreted as data to be interpreted as a command instead. When a SQL query is constructed, the programmer knows what should be interpreted as part of the command and what should be interpreted as data. Parameterized SQL statements can enforce this behavior by disallowing data-directed context changes and preventing nearly all SQL injection attacks. Parameterized SQL statements are constructed using strings of regular SQL, but when user-supplied data needs to be included, they create bind parameters, which are placeholders for data that is subsequently inserted. Bind parameters allow the program to explicitly specify to the database what should be treated as a command and what should be treated as data. When the program is ready to execute a statement, it specifies to the database the runtime values to use for the value of each of the bind parameters, without the risk of the data being interpreted as commands. \n\nThe previous example can be rewritten to use parameterized SQL statements (instead of concatenating user supplied strings) as follows:\n\n...\nString userName = ctx.getAuthenticatedUserName();\nString itemName = request.getParameter(\"itemName\");\nString query =\n        \"SELECT * FROM items WHERE itemname=? AND owner=?\"; \nPreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(query);\nstmt.setString(1, itemName);\nstmt.setString(2, userName);\nResultSet results = stmt.execute();\n...\n\n\nMore complicated scenarios, often found in report generation code, require that user input affect the command structure of the SQL statement, such as the addition of dynamic constraints in the WHERE clause. Do not use this requirement to justify concatenating user input into query strings. Prevent SQL injection attacks where user input must affect statement command structure with a level of indirection: create a set of legitimate strings that correspond to different elements you might include in a SQL statement. When constructing a statement, use input from the user to select from this set of application-controlled values. \n\n\nTips\n\nA common mistake is to use parameterized SQL statements that are constructed by concatenating user-controlled strings.  Of course, this defeats the purpose of using parameterized SQL statements. If you are not certain that the strings used to form statements are constants controlled by the application, do not assume that they are safe because they are not being executed directly as SQL strings. Thoroughly investigate all uses of user-controlled strings in SQL statements and verify that none can be used to modify the meaning of the query. \n\nForitfy RTA adds protection against this category.\n\nReferences\n\nSQL Injection Attacks by Example, S.

            "text" : "Explanation\n\nIf an attacker can supply values that the application then uses to determine which class to instantiate or which method to invoke, the potential exists for the attacker to create control flow paths through the application that were not intended by the application developers. This attack vector may allow the attacker to bypass authentication or access control checks or otherwise cause the application to behave in an unexpected manner. Even the ability to control the arguments passed to a given method or constructor may give a wily attacker the edge necessary to mount a successful attack. \n\nThis situation becomes a doomsday scenario if the attacker can upload files into a location that appears on the application's classpath or add new entries to the application's classpath. Under either of these conditions, the attacker can use reflection to introduce new, presumably malicious, behavior into the application.\n\nIn this case the untrusted data enters the program at  in  at line . It is passed to the reflection API at  in  at line .\n\nExample: A common reason that programmers use the reflection API is to implement their own command dispatcher. The following example shows a command dispatcher that does not use reflection:\n\nString ctl = request.getParameter(\"ctl\");\nWorker ao = null;\nif (ctl.equals(\"Add\")) {\n  ao = new AddCommand();\n} else if (ctl.equals(\"Modify\")) {\n  ao = new ModifyCommand();\n} else {\n  throw new UnknownActionError();\n}\nao.doAction(request);\n\n\nA programmer might refactor this code to use reflection as follows:\n\n    String ctl = request.getParameter(\"ctl\");\n    Class cmdClass = Class.forName(ctl + \"Command\");\n    Worker ao = (Worker) cmdClass.newInstance();\n    ao.doAction(request);\n\n\nThe refactoring initially appears to offer a number of advantages. There are fewer lines of code, the if/else blocks have been entirely eliminated, and it is now possible to add new command types without modifying the command dispatcher.\n\nHowever, the refactoring allows an attacker to instantiate any object that implements the Worker interface. If the command dispatcher is still responsible for access control, then whenever programmers create a new class that implements the Worker interface, they must remember to modify the dispatcher's access control code. If they fail to modify the access control code, then some Worker classes will not have any access control.\n\nOne way to address this access control problem is to make the Worker object responsible for performing the access control check. An example of the re-refactored code follows:\n\nString ctl = request.getParameter(\"ctl\");\nClass cmdClass = Class.forName(ctl + \"Command\");\nWorker ao = (Worker) cmdClass.newInstance();\nao.checkAccessControl(request);\nao.doAction(request);\n\n\nAlthough this is an improvement, it encourages a decentralized approach to access control, which makes it easier for programmers to make access control mistakes.\n\nThis code also highlights another security problem with using reflection to build a command dispatcher. An attacker can invoke the default constructor for any kind of object. In fact, the attacker is not even constrained to objects that implement the Worker interface; the default constructor for any object in the system can be invoked. If the object does not implement the Worker interface, a ClassCastException will be thrown before the assignment to ao, but if the constructor performs operations that work in the attacker's favor, the damage will already have been done. Although this scenario is relatively benign in simple applications, in larger applications where complexity grows exponentially it is not unreasonable that an attacker could find a constructor to leverage as part of an attack. \n\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe best way to prevent unsafe reflection is with a level of indirection: create a list of legitimate names that users are allowed to specify, and only allow users to select from the list. With this approach, input provided by users is never used directly to specify a name that is passed to the reflection API.\n\nReflection can also be used to create a custom data-driven architecture, whereby a configuration file determines the types and combinations of objects that are used by the application. This style of programming introduces the following security concerns:\n\n- The configuration file that controls the program is an essential part of the program's source code and must be protected and reviewed accordingly.\n\n- Because the configuration file is unique to the application, unique work must be performed to evaluate the security of the design.\n\n- Because the semantics of the application are now governed by a configuration file with a custom format, custom rules are required for obtaining optimal static analysis results.\n\nFor these reasons, avoid using this style of design unless your team can devote a large amount of effort to security evaluation.\n\n\nTips\n\nBeware of attempts to validate user input before using it as part of a call to a reflection method. Because the application is likely to evolve faster than the operating system, the file system, or other system components, the work required to validate user input must evolve much more rapidly than the input validation required for sending user data to other system components. Even if the validation is currently correct, it might not be correct in the future.\n\nReferences\n\nCWE ID 470, Common Weakness Enumeration\n\nCWE ID 470, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA1 Unvalidated Input, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2004 - (OWASP 2004)\n\nA4 Insecure Direct Object Reference, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2007 - (OWASP 2007)\n\nRequirement 6.5.1, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.1 - (PCI 1.1)\n\nRequirement 6.3.1.1, 6.5.4, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.2 - (PCI 1.2)\n\nAPP3510 CAT I, APP3570 CAT I, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"

            "text" : "Explanation\n\nSQL injection errors occur when:\n\n1. Data enters a program from an untrusted source.\n\n\nIn this case the data enters at  in  at line . \n\n\n2. The data is used to dynamically construct a SQL query. \n\n\nIn this case the data is passed to  in  at line .\n\n\nExample 1: The following code dynamically constructs and executes a SQL query that searches for items matching a specified name. The query restricts the items displayed to those where the owner matches the user name of the currently-authenticated user. \n\n...\n\tString userName = ctx.getAuthenticatedUserName();\n\tString itemName = request.getParameter(\"itemName\");\n\tString query = \"SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = '\" \n\t\t\t\t+ userName + \"' AND itemname = '\"  \n\t\t\t\t+ itemName + \"'\";\n\tResultSet rs = stmt.execute(query);\n\t...\n\n\nThe query that this code intends to execute follows:\n\n\tSELECT * FROM items\n\tWHERE owner = &lt;userName&gt;\n\tAND itemname = &lt;itemName&gt;;\n\n\nHowever, because the query is constructed dynamically by concatenating a constant base query string and a user input string, the query only behaves correctly if itemName does not contain a single-quote character. If an attacker with the user name wiley enters the string \"name' OR 'a'='a\" for itemName, then the query becomes the following:\n\n\tSELECT * FROM items\n\tWHERE owner = 'wiley'\n\tAND itemname = 'name' OR 'a'='a';\n\n\nThe addition of the OR 'a'='a' condition causes the where clause to always evaluate to true, so the query becomes logically equivalent to the much simpler query:\n\n\tSELECT * FROM items;\n\n\nThis simplification of the query allows the attacker to bypass the requirement that the query only return items owned by the authenticated user; the query now returns all entries stored in the items table, regardless of their specified owner.\n\nExample 2: This example examines the effects of a different malicious value passed to the query constructed and executed in Example 1. If an attacker with the user name wiley enters the string \"name'; DELETE FROM items; --\" for itemName, then the query becomes the following two queries:\n\n\tSELECT * FROM items \n\tWHERE owner = 'wiley'\n\tAND itemname = 'name';\n\n\tDELETE FROM items;\n\n\t--'\n\n\nMany database servers, including Microsoft(R) SQL Server 2000, allow multiple SQL statements separated by semicolons to be executed at once. While this attack string results in an error on Oracle and other database servers that do not allow the batch-execution of statements separated by semicolons, on databases that do allow batch execution, this type of attack allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands against the database. \n\nNotice the trailing pair of hyphens (--), which specifies to most database servers that the remainder of the statement is to be treated as a comment and not executed [4]. In this case the comment character serves to remove the trailing single-quote left over from the modified query. On a database where comments are not allowed to be used in this way, the general attack could still be made effective using a trick similar to the one shown in Example 1. If an attacker enters the string \"name'); DELETE FROM items; SELECT * FROM items WHERE 'a'='a\", the following three valid statements will be created: \n\n\tSELECT * FROM items \n\tWHERE owner = 'wiley'\n\tAND itemname = 'name';\n\n\tDELETE FROM items;\n\n\tSELECT * FROM items WHERE 'a'='a';\n\n\nOne traditional approach to preventing SQL injection attacks is to handle them as an input validation problem and either accept only characters from a whitelist of safe values or identify and escape a blacklist of potentially malicious values. Whitelisting can be a very effective means of enforcing strict input validation rules, but parameterized SQL statements require less maintenance and can offer more guarantees with respect to security. As is almost always the case, blacklisting is riddled with loopholes that make it ineffective at preventing SQL injection attacks. For example, attackers can:\n\n- Target fields that are not quoted\n\n- Find ways to bypass the need for certain escaped meta-characters\n\n- Use stored procedures to hide the injected meta-characters\n\nManually escaping characters in input to SQL queries can help, but it will not make your application secure from SQL injection attacks. \n\nAnother solution commonly proposed for dealing with SQL injection attacks is to use stored procedures. Although stored procedures prevent some types of SQL injection attacks, they fail to protect against many others. Stored procedures typically help prevent SQL injection attacks by limiting the types of statements that can be passed to their parameters. However, there are many ways around the limitations and many interesting statements that can still be passed to stored procedures. Again, stored procedures can prevent some exploits, but they will not make your application secure against SQL injection attacks. \n\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe root cause of a SQL injection vulnerability is the ability of an attacker to change context in the SQL query, causing a value that the programmer intended to be interpreted as data to be interpreted as a command instead. When a SQL query is constructed, the programmer knows what should be interpreted as part of the command and what should be interpreted as data. Parameterized SQL statements can enforce this behavior by disallowing data-directed context changes and preventing nearly all SQL injection attacks. Parameterized SQL statements are constructed using strings of regular SQL, but where user-supplied data needs to be included, they include bind parameters, which are placeholders for data that is subsequently inserted. In other words, bind parameters allow the programmer to explicitly specify to the database what should be treated as a command and what should be treated as data. When the program is ready to execute a statement, it specifies to the database the runtime values to use for each of the bind parameters without the risk that the data will be interpreted as a modification to the command.\n\nThe previous example can be rewritten to use parameterized SQL statements (instead of concatenating user supplied strings) as follows:\n\n...\nString userName = ctx.getAuthenticatedUserName();\nString itemName = request.getParameter(\"itemName\");\nString query =\n \t       \"SELECT * FROM items WHERE itemname=? AND owner=?\"; \nPreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(query);\nstmt.setString(1, itemName);\nstmt.setString(2, userName);\nResultSet results = stmt.execute();\n...\n\n\nMore complicated scenarios, often found in report generation code, require that user input affect the structure of the SQL statement, for instance by adding a dynamic constraint in the WHERE clause. Do not use this requirement to justify concatenating user input to create a query string. Prevent SQL injection attacks where user input must affect command structure with a level of indirection: create a set of legitimate strings that correspond to different elements you might include in a SQL statement. When constructing a statement, use input from the user to select from this set of application-controlled values. \n\n\nTips\n\nA common mistake is to use parameterized SQL statements that are constructed by concatenating user-controlled strings. Of course, this defeats the purpose of using parameterized SQL statements. If you are not certain that the strings used to form parameterized statements are constants controlled by the application, do not assume that they are safe because they are not being executed directly as SQL strings. Thoroughly investigate all uses of user-controlled strings in SQL statements and verify that none can be used to modify the meaning of the query. \n\nForitfy RTA adds protection against this category.\n\nReferences\n\nSQL Injection Attacks by Example, S.

            "text" : "Explanation\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source. In the case of Reflected XSS, the untrusted source is typically a web request, while in the case of Persisted (also known as Stored) XSS it is typically a database or other back-end datastore.\n\n\nIn this case the data enters at  in  at line . \n\n2. The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated for malicious code. \n\nIn this case the data is sent at  in  at line .\n\nThe malicious content sent to the web browser often takes the form of a segment of JavaScript, but may also include HTML, Flash or any other type of code that the browser may execute. The variety of attacks based on XSS is almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting private data like cookies or other session information to the attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.\n\nExample 1: The following JSP code segment reads an employee ID, eid, from an HTTP request and displays it to the user. \n\n&lt;% String eid = request.getParameter(\"eid\"); %&gt; \n...\nEmployee ID: &lt;%= eid %&gt;\n\n\nThe code in this example operates correctly if eid contains only standard alphanumeric text. If eid has a value that includes meta-characters or source code, then the code will be executed by the web browser as it displays the HTTP response.\n\nInitially this might not appear to be much of a vulnerability. After all, why would someone enter a URL that causes malicious code to run on their own computer? The real danger is that an attacker will create the malicious URL, then use e-mail or social engineering tricks to lure victims into visiting a link to the URL. When victims click the link, they unwittingly reflect the malicious content through the vulnerable web application back to their own computers. This mechanism of exploiting vulnerable web applications is known as Reflected XSS.\n\nExample 2: The following JSP code segment queries a database for an employee with a given ID and prints the corresponding employee's name.\n\n \n&lt;%... \n Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();\n ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(\"select * from emp where id=\"+eid);\n if (rs != null) {\n  rs.next(); \n  String name = rs.getString(\"name\");\n%&gt;\n\nEmployee Name: &lt;%= name %&gt;\n\n\nAs in Example 1, this code functions correctly when the values of name are well-behaved, but it does nothing to prevent exploits if they are not. Again, this code can appear less dangerous because the value of name is read from a database, whose contents are apparently managed by the application. However, if the value of name originates from user-supplied data, then the database can be a conduit for malicious content. Without proper input validation on all data stored in the database, an attacker can execute malicious commands in the user's web browser. This type of exploit, known as Persistent (or Stored) XSS, is particularly insidious because the indirection caused by the data store makes it more difficult to identify the threat and increases the possibility that the attack will affect multiple users. XSS got its start in this form with web sites that offered a \"guestbook\" to visitors. Attackers would include JavaScript in their guestbook entries, and all subsequent visitors to the guestbook page would execute the malicious code.\n\nAs the examples demonstrate, XSS vulnerabilities are caused by code that includes unvalidated data in an HTTP response. There are three vectors by which an XSS attack can reach a victim:\n\n- As in Example 1, data is read directly from the HTTP request and reflected back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a user to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the user and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to victims. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces victims to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the user, the content is executed and proceeds to transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the user's machine to the attacker or perform other nefarious activities.\n\n- As in Example 2, the application stores dangerous data in a database or other trusted data store. The dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. Persistent XSS exploits occur when an attacker injects dangerous content into a data store that is later read and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user.\n\n- A source outside the application stores dangerous data in a database or other data store, and the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application as trusted data and included in dynamic content.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe solution to XSS is to ensure that validation occurs in the correct places and checks for the correct properties.\n\nSince XSS vulnerabilities occur when an application includes malicious data in its output, one logical approach is to validate data immediately before it leaves the application. However, because web applications often have complex and intricate code for generating dynamic content, this method is prone to errors of omission (missing validation). An effective way to mitigate this risk is to also perform input validation for XSS.\n\nWeb applications must validate their input to prevent other vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, so augmenting an application's existing input validation mechanism to include checks for XSS is generally relatively easy. Despite its value, input validation for XSS does not take the place of rigorous output validation. An application may accept input through a shared data store or other trusted source, and that data store may accept input from a source that does not perform adequate input validation. Therefore, the application cannot implicitly rely on the safety of this or any other data. This means the best way to prevent XSS vulnerabilities is to validate everything that enters the application or leaves the application destined for the user. \n\nThe most secure approach to validation for XSS is to create a whitelist of safe characters that are allowed to appear in HTTP content and accept input composed exclusively of characters in the approved set. For example, a valid username might only include alpha-numeric characters or a phone number might only include digits 0-9. However, this solution is often infeasible in web applications because many characters that have special meaning to the browser should still be considered valid input once they are encoded, such as a web design bulletin board that must accept HTML fragments from its users. \n\nA more flexible, but less secure approach is known as blacklisting, which selectively rejects or escapes potentially dangerous characters before using the input. In order to form such a list, you first need to understand the set of characters that hold special meaning for web browsers. Although the HTML standard defines what characters have special meaning, many web browsers try to correct common mistakes in HTML and may treat other characters as special in certain contexts. The CERT(R) Coordination Center at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University provides the following details about special characters in various contexts [1]:\n\nIn the content of a block-level element (in the middle of a paragraph of text):\n\n- \"&lt;\" is special because it introduces a tag.\n\n- \"&amp;\" is special because it introduces a character entity.\n\n- \"&gt;\" is special because some browsers treat it as special, on the assumption that the author of the page intended to include an opening \"&lt;\", but omitted it in error.\n\nThe following principles apply to attribute values:\n\n- In attribute values enclosed with double quotes, the double quotes are special because they mark the end of the attribute value.\n\n- In attribute values enclosed with single quote, the single quotes are special because they mark the end of the attribute value.\n\n- In attribute values without any quotes, white-space characters, such as space and tab, are special.\n\n- \"&amp;\" is special when used with certain attributes, because it introduces a character entity. \n\nIn URLs, for example, a search engine might provide a link within the results page that the user can click to re-run the search. This can be implemented by encoding the search query inside the URL, which introduces additional special characters:\n\n- Space, tab, and new line are special because they mark the end of the URL.\n\n- \"&amp;\" is special because it either introduces a character entity or separates CGI parameters.\n\n- Non-ASCII characters (that is, everything above 128 in the ISO-8859-1 encoding) are not allowed in URLs, so they are considered to be special in this context.\n\n- The \"%\" symbol must be filtered from input anywhere parameters encoded with HTTP escape sequences are decoded by server-side code. For example, \"%\" must be filtered if input such as \"%68%65%6C%6C%6F\" becomes \"hello\" when it appears on the web page in question.\n\n\nWithin the body of a &lt;SCRIPT&gt; &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;:\n\n- The semicolon, parenthesis, curly braces, and new line should be filtered in situations where text could be inserted directly into a pre-existing script tag. \n\nServer-side scripts:\n\n- Server-side scripts that convert any exclamation characters (!) in input to double-quote characters (\") on output might require additional filtering. \n\nOther possibilities:\n\n- If an attacker submits a request in UTF-7, the special character '&lt;' appears as '+ADw-' and may bypass filtering. If the output is included in a page that does not explicitly specify an encoding format, then some browsers try to intelligently identify the encoding based on the content (in this case, UTF-7).\n\nOnce you identify the correct points in an application to perform validation for XSS attacks and what special characters the validation should consider, the next challenge is to identify how your validation handles special characters. If special characters are not considered valid input to the application, then you can reject any input that contains special characters as invalid. A second option in this situation is to remove special characters with filtering. However, filtering has the side effect of changing any visual representation of the filtered content and may be unacceptable in circumstances where the integrity of the input must be preserved for display.\n\nIf input containing special characters must be accepted and displayed accurately, validation must encode any special characters to remove their significance. A complete list of ISO 8859-1 encoded values for special characters is provided as part of the official HTML specification [2].\n\nMany application servers attempt to limit an application's exposure to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities by providing implementations for the functions responsible for setting certain specific HTTP response content that perform validation for the characters essential to a cross-site scripting attack. Do not rely on the server running your application to make it secure. When an application is developed there are no guarantees about what application servers it will run on during its lifetime. As standards and known exploits evolve, there are no guarantees that application servers will also stay in sync.\n\nTips\n\nIn Fortify Source Code Analysis Suite, the database is treated as a source of untrusted data for XSS vulnerabilities. If the database is a trusted resource in your environment, customize Audit Workbench to filter out data flow issues generated by database sources.\n\nForitfy RTA adds protection against this category.\n\nReferences\n\nUnderstanding Malicious Content Mitigation for Web Developers, CERT, http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_mitigation.html#9\n\nHTML 4.01 Specification, W3, http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/entities.html#h-24.2\n\nCWE ID 79, Common Weakness Enumeration\n\nCWE ID 79, 80, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA4 Cross Site Scripting, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2004 - (OWASP 2004)\n\nA1 Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2007 - (OWASP 2007)\n\nRequirement 6.5.4, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.1 - (PCI 1.1)\n\nRequirement 6.3.1.1, 6.5.1, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.2 - (PCI 1.2)\n\nAPP3510 CAT I, APP3580 CAT I, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n\nCross-site Scripting, Standards Mapping - Web Application Security Consortium 24 + 2 - (WASC 24 + 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"

Encryption algorithms rely on key size as one of the primary mechanism to ensure cryptographic strength. Cryptographic strength is often measured by the time and computational power needed to generate a valid key. Advances in computing power have made it possible to obtain small encryption keys in a reasonable amount of time. For example, the 56-bit key used in DES posed a significant computational hurdle in the 1970's when the algorithm was first developed, but today DES can be cracked in less than a day using commonly available equipment.\n      \n\nRecommendations\n\nUse strong encryption algorithms with large key sizes to protect sensitive data. Examples of strong alternatives to DES are Rijndael (Advanced Encryption Standard or AES) and Triple DES (3DES).

(i.e. make all member fields static final).\n\nDevelopers are often tempted to use Servlet member fields for user data when they need to transport data from one region of code to another. If this is your aim, consider declaring a separate class and using the Servlet only to \"wrap\" this new class. \n\nExample 2: The bug in the example above can be corrected in the following way:\n\npublic class GuestBook extends HttpServlet {\n\n   protected void doPost (HttpServletRequest req,\n                       HttpServletResponse res) {\n\tGBRequestHandler handler = new GBRequestHandler();\n\thandler.handle(req, res);\n   }\n}\n\npublic class GBRequestHandler {\n\n   String name;\n\n   public void handle(HttpServletRequest req,\n                       HttpServletResponse res) {\n     name = req.getParameter(\"name\");\n     ...\n     out.println(name + \", thanks for visiting!\");\n   }\n\n}\n\n\nAlternatively, a Servlet can implement the SingleThreadModel interface, in which case the Servlet container will maintain a pool of Servlet objects and dispatch a different object to process each request. Depending on the container implementation and the needs of the application, using the SingleThreadModel interface may cause significant performance problems.\n\nTips\n\n-\n\nReferences\n\nThe Java Servlet Specification, Sun Microsystems, http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/download.html\n\nCWE ID 488, Common Weakness Enumeration\n\nCWE ID 362, 488, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA6 Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2007 - (OWASP 2007)\n\nRequirement 6.5.6, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.2 - (PCI 1.2)\n\nAPP3630.1 CAT II, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"

For example, a database error message can reveal that the application is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. Other error messages can reveal more oblique clues about the system. In the example above, the search path could imply information about the type of operating system, the applications installed on the system, and the amount of care that the administrators have put into configuring the program.\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nWrite error messages with security in mind. In production environments, turn off detailed error information in favor of brief messages. Restrict the generation and storage of detailed output that can help administrators and programmers diagnose problems. Be careful, debugging traces can sometimes appear in non-obvious places (embedded in comments in the HTML for an error page, for example).\n\nEven brief error messages that do not reveal stack traces or database dumps can potentially aid an attacker.

Write software that is secure on its own.\n\nThis category of vulnerability does not apply to all types of programs.

The finalize() method for FileInputStream eventually calls close(), but there is no guarantee as to how long it will take before the finalize() method will be invoked. In a busy environment, this can result in the JVM using up all of its file handles.\n\nprivate void processFile(String fName) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException\n{\n  FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(fName);\n  int sz;\n  byte[] byteArray = new byte[BLOCK_SIZE];\n  while ((sz = fis.read(byteArray)) != -1) {\n    processBytes(byteArray, sz);\n  }\n}\n\n\nExample 2: Under normal conditions, the following code executes a database query, processes the results returned by the database, and closes the allocated statement object. But if an exception occurs while executing the SQL or processing the results, the statement object will not be closed. If this happens often enough, the database will run out of available cursors and not be able to execute any more SQL queries.\n\n  Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();\n  ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(CXN_SQL);\n  harvestResults(rs);\n  stmt.close();\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\n1. Never rely on finalize() to reclaim resources. In order for an object's finalize() method to be invoked, the garbage collector must determine that the object is eligible for garbage collection. Because the garbage collector is not required to run unless the JVM is low on memory, there is no guarantee that an object's finalize() method will be invoked in an expedient fashion. When the garbage collector finally does run, it may cause a large number of resources to be reclaimed in a short period of time, which can lead to \"bursty\" performance and lower overall system throughput. This effect becomes more pronounced as the load on the system increases.\n\nFinally, if it is possible for a resource reclamation operation to hang (if it requires communicating over a network to a database, for example), then the thread that is executing the finalize() method will hang. \n\n2. Release resources in a finally block. The code for Example 2 should be rewritten as follows:\n\n  public void execCxnSql(Connection conn) {\n    Statement stmt;\n    try {\n      stmt = conn.createStatement();\n      ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(CXN_SQL);\n      ...\n    }\n    finally {\n      if (stmt != null) {\n        safeClose(stmt);\n      }\n    }\n}\n\npublic static void safeClose(Statement stmt) {\n  if (stmt != null) {\n    try {\n      stmt.close();\n    } catch (SQLException e) {\n      log(e);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nThis solution uses a helper function to log the exceptions that might occur when trying to close the statement. Presumably this helper function will be reused whenever a statement needs to be closed. \n\nAlso, the execCxnSql method does not initialize the stmt object to null. Instead, it checks to ensure that stmt is not null before calling safeClose(). Without the null check, the Java compiler reports that stmt might not be initialized. This choice takes advantage of Java's ability to detect uninitialized variables. If  stmt is initialized to null in a more complex method, cases in which stmt is used without being initialized will not be detected by the compiler. \n\n\nTips\n\n-\n\nReferences\n\nCWE ID 404, Common Weakness Enumeration\n\nCWE ID 404, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA9 Application Denial of Service, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2004 - (OWASP 2004)\n\nRequirement 6.5.9, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.1 - (PCI 1.1)\n\nAPP6080 CAT II, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"

The data is written to an application or system log file. \n\nIn this case the data is logged by  in  at line .\n\nApplications typically use log files to store a history of events or transactions for later review, statistics gathering, or debugging. Depending on the nature of the application, the task of reviewing log files may be performed manually on an as-needed basis or automated with a tool that automatically culls logs for important events or trending information.\n\nInterpretation of the log files may be hindered or misdirected if an attacker can supply data to the application that is subsequently logged verbatim. In the most benign case, an attacker may be able to insert false entries into the log file by providing the application with input that includes appropriate characters. If the log file is processed automatically, the attacker can render the file unusable by corrupting the format of the file or injecting unexpected characters. A more subtle attack might involve skewing the log file statistics. Forged or otherwise, corrupted log files can be used to cover an attacker's tracks or even to implicate another party in the commission of a malicious act [1]. In the worst case, an attacker may inject code or other commands into the log file and take advantage of a vulnerability in the log processing utility [2].\n\nExample: The following web application code attempts to read an integer value from a request object. If the value fails to parse as an integer, then the input is logged with an error message indicating what happened. \n\nString val = request.getParameter(\"val\");\ntry {\n  int value = Integer.parseInt(val);\n}\ncatch (NumberFormatException) {\n  log.info(\"Failed to parse val = \" + val);\n}\n\n\nIf a user submits the string \"twenty-one\" for val, the following entry is logged:\n\nINFO: Failed to parse val=twenty-one\n\n\nHowever, if an attacker submits the string \"twenty-one%0a%0aINFO:+User+logged+out%3dbadguy\", the following entry is logged:\n\nINFO: Failed to parse val=twenty-one\n\nINFO: User logged out=badguy\n\n\nClearly, attackers can use this same mechanism to insert arbitrary log entries.\n\nRecommendations\n\nPrevent log forging attacks with indirection: create a set of legitimate log entries that correspond to different events that must be logged and only log entries from this set. To capture dynamic content, such as users logging out of the system, always use server-controlled values rather than user-supplied data. This ensures that the input provided by the user is never used directly in a log entry. \n\nIn some situations this approach is impractical because the set of legitimate log entries is too large or complicated. In these situations, developers often fall back on blacklisting. Blacklisting selectively rejects or escapes potentially dangerous characters before using the input. However, a list of unsafe characters can quickly become incomplete or outdated. A better approach is to create a white list of characters that are allowed to appear in log entries and accept input composed exclusively of characters in the approved set. The most critical character in most log forging attacks is the '\n' (newline) character, which should never appear on a log entry white list.\n\nTips\n\nMany logging operations are created only for the purpose of debugging a program during development and testing. In our experience, debugging will be enabled, either accidentally or purposefully, in production at some point. Do not excuse log forging vulnerabilities simply because a programmer says \"I don't have any plans to turn that on in production\".\n\nReferences\n\nThe night the log was forged., A.

            "text" : "Explanation\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source. In the case of Reflected XSS, the untrusted source is typically a web request, while in the case of Persisted (also known as Stored) XSS it is typically a database or other back-end datastore.\n\n\nIn this case the data enters at  in  at line . \n\n2. The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated for malicious code. \n\nIn this case the data is sent at  in  at line .\n\nThe malicious content sent to the web browser often takes the form of a segment of JavaScript, but may also include HTML, Flash or any other type of code that the browser may execute. The variety of attacks based on XSS is almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting private data like cookies or other session information to the attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.\n\nExample 1: The following JSP code segment reads an employee ID, eid, from an HTTP request and displays it to the user. \n\n&lt;% String eid = request.getParameter(\"eid\"); %&gt; \n...\nEmployee ID: &lt;%= eid %&gt;\n\n\nThe code in this example operates correctly if eid contains only standard alphanumeric text. If eid has a value that includes meta-characters or source code, then the code will be executed by the web browser as it displays the HTTP response.\n\nInitially this might not appear to be much of a vulnerability. After all, why would someone enter a URL that causes malicious code to run on their own computer? The real danger is that an attacker will create the malicious URL, then use e-mail or social engineering tricks to lure victims into visiting a link to the URL. When victims click the link, they unwittingly reflect the malicious content through the vulnerable web application back to their own computers. This mechanism of exploiting vulnerable web applications is known as Reflected XSS.\n\nExample 2: The following JSP code segment queries a database for an employee with a given ID and prints the corresponding employee's name.\n\n \n&lt;%... \n Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();\n ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(\"select * from emp where id=\"+eid);\n if (rs != null) {\n  rs.next(); \n  String name = rs.getString(\"name\");\n%&gt;\n\nEmployee Name: &lt;%= name %&gt;\n\n\nAs in Example 1, this code functions correctly when the values of name are well-behaved, but it does nothing to prevent exploits if they are not. Again, this code can appear less dangerous because the value of name is read from a database, whose contents are apparently managed by the application. However, if the value of name originates from user-supplied data, then the database can be a conduit for malicious content. Without proper input validation on all data stored in the database, an attacker can execute malicious commands in the user's web browser. This type of exploit, known as Persistent (or Stored) XSS, is particularly insidious because the indirection caused by the data store makes it more difficult to identify the threat and increases the possibility that the attack will affect multiple users. XSS got its start in this form with web sites that offered a \"guestbook\" to visitors. Attackers would include JavaScript in their guestbook entries, and all subsequent visitors to the guestbook page would execute the malicious code.\n\nAs the examples demonstrate, XSS vulnerabilities are caused by code that includes unvalidated data in an HTTP response. There are three vectors by which an XSS attack can reach a victim:\n\n- As in Example 1, data is read directly from the HTTP request and reflected back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a user to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the user and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to victims. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces victims to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the user, the content is executed and proceeds to transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the user's machine to the attacker or perform other nefarious activities.\n\n- As in Example 2, the application stores dangerous data in a database or other trusted data store. The dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. Persistent XSS exploits occur when an attacker injects dangerous content into a data store that is later read and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user.\n\n- A source outside the application stores dangerous data in a database or other data store, and the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application as trusted data and included in dynamic content.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe solution to XSS is to ensure that validation occurs in the correct places and checks for the correct properties.\n\nSince XSS vulnerabilities occur when an application includes malicious data in its output, one logical approach is to validate data immediately before it leaves the application. However, because web applications often have complex and intricate code for generating dynamic content, this method is prone to errors of omission (missing validation). An effective way to mitigate this risk is to also perform input validation for XSS.\n\nWeb applications must validate their input to prevent other vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, so augmenting an application's existing input validation mechanism to include checks for XSS is generally relatively easy. Despite its value, input validation for XSS does not take the place of rigorous output validation. An application may accept input through a shared data store or other trusted source, and that data store may accept input from a source that does not perform adequate input validation. Therefore, the application cannot implicitly rely on the safety of this or any other data. This means the best way to prevent XSS vulnerabilities is to validate everything that enters the application or leaves the application destined for the user. \n\nThe most secure approach to validation for XSS is to create a whitelist of safe characters that are allowed to appear in HTTP content and accept input composed exclusively of characters in the approved set. For example, a valid username might only include alpha-numeric characters or a phone number might only include digits 0-9. However, this solution is often infeasible in web applications because many characters that have special meaning to the browser should still be considered valid input once they are encoded, such as a web design bulletin board that must accept HTML fragments from its users. \n\nA more flexible, but less secure approach is known as blacklisting, which selectively rejects or escapes potentially dangerous characters before using the input. In order to form such a list, you first need to understand the set of characters that hold special meaning for web browsers. Although the HTML standard defines what characters have special meaning, many web browsers try to correct common mistakes in HTML and may treat other characters as special in certain contexts. The CERT(R) Coordination Center at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University provides the following details about special characters in various contexts [1]:\n\nIn the content of a block-level element (in the middle of a paragraph of text):\n\n- \"&lt;\" is special because it introduces a tag.\n\n- \"&amp;\" is special because it introduces a character entity.\n\n- \"&gt;\" is special because some browsers treat it as special, on the assumption that the author of the page intended to include an opening \"&lt;\", but omitted it in error.\n\nThe following principles apply to attribute values:\n\n- In attribute values enclosed with double quotes, the double quotes are special because they mark the end of the attribute value.\n\n- In attribute values enclosed with single quote, the single quotes are special because they mark the end of the attribute value.\n\n- In attribute values without any quotes, white-space characters, such as space and tab, are special.\n\n- \"&amp;\" is special when used with certain attributes, because it introduces a character entity. \n\nIn URLs, for example, a search engine might provide a link within the results page that the user can click to re-run the search. This can be implemented by encoding the search query inside the URL, which introduces additional special characters:\n\n- Space, tab, and new line are special because they mark the end of the URL.\n\n- \"&amp;\" is special because it either introduces a character entity or separates CGI parameters.\n\n- Non-ASCII characters (that is, everything above 128 in the ISO-8859-1 encoding) are not allowed in URLs, so they are considered to be special in this context.\n\n- The \"%\" symbol must be filtered from input anywhere parameters encoded with HTTP escape sequences are decoded by server-side code. For example, \"%\" must be filtered if input such as \"%68%65%6C%6C%6F\" becomes \"hello\" when it appears on the web page in question.\n\n\nWithin the body of a &lt;SCRIPT&gt; &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;:\n\n- The semicolon, parenthesis, curly braces, and new line should be filtered in situations where text could be inserted directly into a pre-existing script tag. \n\nServer-side scripts:\n\n- Server-side scripts that convert any exclamation characters (!) in input to double-quote characters (\") on output might require additional filtering. \n\nOther possibilities:\n\n- If an attacker submits a request in UTF-7, the special character '&lt;' appears as '+ADw-' and may bypass filtering. If the output is included in a page that does not explicitly specify an encoding format, then some browsers try to intelligently identify the encoding based on the content (in this case, UTF-7).\n\nOnce you identify the correct points in an application to perform validation for XSS attacks and what special characters the validation should consider, the next challenge is to identify how your validation handles special characters. If special characters are not considered valid input to the application, then you can reject any input that contains special characters as invalid. A second option in this situation is to remove special characters with filtering. However, filtering has the side effect of changing any visual representation of the filtered content and may be unacceptable in circumstances where the integrity of the input must be preserved for display.\n\nIf input containing special characters must be accepted and displayed accurately, validation must encode any special characters to remove their significance. A complete list of ISO 8859-1 encoded values for special characters is provided as part of the official HTML specification [2].\n\nMany application servers attempt to limit an application's exposure to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities by providing implementations for the functions responsible for setting certain specific HTTP response content that perform validation for the characters essential to a cross-site scripting attack. Do not rely on the server running your application to make it secure. When an application is developed there are no guarantees about what application servers it will run on during its lifetime. As standards and known exploits evolve, there are no guarantees that application servers will also stay in sync.\n\nTips\n\nIn Fortify Source Code Analysis Suite, the database is treated as a source of untrusted data for XSS vulnerabilities.

            "text" : "Explanation\n\nSQL injection errors occur when:\n\n1. Data enters a program from an untrusted source.\n\n\nIn this case the data enters at  in  at line . \n\n\n2. The data is used to dynamically construct a SQL query. \n\n\nIn this case the data is passed to  in  at line .\n\n\nExample 1: The following code dynamically constructs and executes a SQL query that searches for items matching a specified name. The query restricts the items displayed to those where the owner matches the user name of the currently-authenticated user. \n\n...\n\tString userName = ctx.getAuthenticatedUserName();\n\tString itemName = request.getParameter(\"itemName\");\n\tString query = \"SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = '\" \n\t\t\t\t+ userName + \"' AND itemname = '\"  \n\t\t\t\t+ itemName + \"'\";\n\tResultSet rs = stmt.execute(query);\n\t...\n\n\nThe query that this code intends to execute follows:\n\n\tSELECT * FROM items\n\tWHERE owner = &lt;userName&gt;\n\tAND itemname = &lt;itemName&gt;;\n\n\nHowever, because the query is constructed dynamically by concatenating a constant base query string and a user input string, the query only behaves correctly if itemName does not contain a single-quote character. If an attacker with the user name wiley enters the string \"name' OR 'a'='a\" for itemName, then the query becomes the following:\n\n\tSELECT * FROM items\n\tWHERE owner = 'wiley'\n\tAND itemname = 'name' OR 'a'='a';\n\n\nThe addition of the OR 'a'='a' condition causes the where clause to always evaluate to true, so the query becomes logically equivalent to the much simpler query:\n\n\tSELECT * FROM items;\n\n\nThis simplification of the query allows the attacker to bypass the requirement that the query only return items owned by the authenticated user; the query now returns all entries stored in the items table, regardless of their specified owner.\n\nExample 2: This example examines the effects of a different malicious value passed to the query constructed and executed in Example 1. If an attacker with the user name wiley enters the string \"name'; DELETE FROM items; --\" for itemName, then the query becomes the following two queries:\n\n\tSELECT * FROM items \n\tWHERE owner = 'wiley'\n\tAND itemname = 'name';\n\n\tDELETE FROM items;\n\n\t--'\n\n\nMany database servers, including Microsoft(R) SQL Server 2000, allow multiple SQL statements separated by semicolons to be executed at once. While this attack string results in an error on Oracle and other database servers that do not allow the batch-execution of statements separated by semicolons, on databases that do allow batch execution, this type of attack allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands against the database. \n\nNotice the trailing pair of hyphens (--), which specifies to most database servers that the remainder of the statement is to be treated as a comment and not executed [4]. In this case the comment character serves to remove the trailing single-quote left over from the modified query. On a database where comments are not allowed to be used in this way, the general attack could still be made effective using a trick similar to the one shown in Example 1. If an attacker enters the string \"name'); DELETE FROM items; SELECT * FROM items WHERE 'a'='a\", the following three valid statements will be created: \n\n\tSELECT * FROM items \n\tWHERE owner = 'wiley'\n\tAND itemname = 'name';\n\n\tDELETE FROM items;\n\n\tSELECT * FROM items WHERE 'a'='a';\n\n\nOne traditional approach to preventing SQL injection attacks is to handle them as an input validation problem and either accept only characters from a whitelist of safe values or identify and escape a blacklist of potentially malicious values. Whitelisting can be a very effective means of enforcing strict input validation rules, but parameterized SQL statements require less maintenance and can offer more guarantees with respect to security. As is almost always the case, blacklisting is riddled with loopholes that make it ineffective at preventing SQL injection attacks. For example, attackers can:\n\n- Target fields that are not quoted\n\n- Find ways to bypass the need for certain escaped meta-characters\n\n- Use stored procedures to hide the injected meta-characters\n\nManually escaping characters in input to SQL queries can help, but it will not make your application secure from SQL injection attacks. \n\nAnother solution commonly proposed for dealing with SQL injection attacks is to use stored procedures. Although stored procedures prevent some types of SQL injection attacks, they fail to protect against many others. Stored procedures typically help prevent SQL injection attacks by limiting the types of statements that can be passed to their parameters. However, there are many ways around the limitations and many interesting statements that can still be passed to stored procedures. Again, stored procedures can prevent some exploits, but they will not make your application secure against SQL injection attacks. \n\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe root cause of a SQL injection vulnerability is the ability of an attacker to change context in the SQL query, causing a value that the programmer intended to be interpreted as data to be interpreted as a command instead. When a SQL query is constructed, the programmer knows what should be interpreted as part of the command and what should be interpreted as data. Parameterized SQL statements can enforce this behavior by disallowing data-directed context changes and preventing nearly all SQL injection attacks. Parameterized SQL statements are constructed using strings of regular SQL, but where user-supplied data needs to be included, they include bind parameters, which are placeholders for data that is subsequently inserted. In other words, bind parameters allow the programmer to explicitly specify to the database what should be treated as a command and what should be treated as data. When the program is ready to execute a statement, it specifies to the database the runtime values to use for each of the bind parameters without the risk that the data will be interpreted as a modification to the command.\n\nThe previous example can be rewritten to use parameterized SQL statements (instead of concatenating user supplied strings) as follows:\n\n...\nString userName = ctx.getAuthenticatedUserName();\nString itemName = request.getParameter(\"itemName\");\nString query =\n \t       \"SELECT * FROM items WHERE itemname=? AND owner=?\"; \nPreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(query);\nstmt.setString(1, itemName);\nstmt.setString(2, userName);\nResultSet results = stmt.execute();\n...\n\n\nMore complicated scenarios, often found in report generation code, require that user input affect the structure of the SQL statement, for instance by adding a dynamic constraint in the WHERE clause. Do not use this requirement to justify concatenating user input to create a query string. Prevent SQL injection attacks where user input must affect command structure with a level of indirection: create a set of legitimate strings that correspond to different elements you might include in a SQL statement. When constructing a statement, use input from the user to select from this set of application-controlled values. \n\n\nTips\n\nA common mistake is to use parameterized SQL statements that are constructed by concatenating user-controlled strings. Of course, this defeats the purpose of using parameterized SQL statements. If you are not certain that the strings used to form parameterized statements are constants controlled by the application, do not assume that they are safe because they are not being executed directly as SQL strings. Thoroughly investigate all uses of user-controlled strings in SQL statements and verify that none can be used to modify the meaning of the query. \n\nForitfy RTA adds protection against this category.\n\nReferences\n\nSQL Injection Attacks by Example, S.

            "text" : "Explanation\n\nIt is never a good idea to hardcode a password. Not only does hardcoding a password allow all of the project's developers to view the password, it also makes fixing the problem extremely difficult. Once the code is in production, the password cannot be changed without patching the software. If the account protected by the password is compromised, the owners of the system will be forced to choose between security and availability.\n\nIn this case a hardcoded password was found in the call to  in  at line .\n\n\nExample: The following code uses a hardcoded password to connect to a database:\n\n...\nDriverManager.getConnection(url, \"scott\", \"tiger\");\n...\n\n\nThis code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to it will have access to the password. Once the program has shipped, there is no going back from the database user \"scott\" with a password of \"tiger\" unless the program is patched. A devious employee with access to this information can use it to break into the system. Even worse, if attackers have access to the bytecode for application, they can use the javap -c command to access the disassembled code, which will contain the values of the passwords used. The result of this operation might look something like the following for the example above:\n\njavap -c ConnMngr.class\n\n22: ldc   #36; //String jdbc:mysql://ixne.com/rxsql\n24: ldc   #38; //String scott\n26: ldc   #17; //String tiger\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nPasswords should never be hardcoded and should generally be obfuscated and managed in an external source. Storing passwords in plaintext anywhere on the system allows anyone with sufficient permissions to read and potentially misuse the password.\n\nSome third party products claim the ability to manage passwords in a more secure way. For example, WebSphere Application Server 4.x uses a simple XOR encryption algorithm for obfuscating values, but be skeptical about such facilities. WebSphere and other application servers offer outdated and relatively weak encryption mechanisms that are insufficient for security-sensitive environments. For a secure solution, the only viable option available today appears to be a proprietary one that you create.\n\n\nTips\n\nAvoid hardcoding passwords in source code and avoid using default passwords. If a hardcoded password is the default, require that it be changed and remove it from the source code.\n\nThe Fortify Java Annotations FortifyPassword and FortifyNotPassword can be used to indicate which fields and variables represent passwords.\n\nReferences\n\nCWE ID 259, Common Weakness Enumeration\n\nCWE ID 259, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA8 Insecure Storage, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2004 - (OWASP 2004)\n\nA8 Insecure Cryptographic Storage, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2007 - (OWASP 2007)\n\nRequirement 3.4, 6.5.8, 8.4, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.1 - (PCI 1.1)\n\nRequirement 3.4, 6.3.1.3, 6.5.8, 8.4, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.2 - (PCI 1.2)\n\nAPP3210.4 CAT II, APP3340 CAT I, APP3350 CAT I, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"

The finalize() method for FileInputStream eventually calls close(), but there is no guarantee as to how long it will take before the finalize() method will be invoked. In a busy environment, this can result in the JVM using up all of its file handles.\n\nprivate void processFile(String fName) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException\n{\n  FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(fName);\n  int sz;\n  byte[] byteArray = new byte[BLOCK_SIZE];\n  while ((sz = fis.read(byteArray)) != -1) {\n    processBytes(byteArray, sz);\n  }\n}\n\n\nExample 2: Under normal conditions, the following code executes a database query, processes the results returned by the database, and closes the allocated statement object. But if an exception occurs while executing the SQL or processing the results, the statement object will not be closed. If this happens often enough, the database will run out of available cursors and not be able to execute any more SQL queries.\n\n  Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();\n  ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(CXN_SQL);\n  harvestResults(rs);\n  stmt.close();\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\n1. Never rely on finalize() to reclaim resources. In order for an object's finalize() method to be invoked, the garbage collector must determine that the object is eligible for garbage collection. Because the garbage collector is not required to run unless the JVM is low on memory, there is no guarantee that an object's finalize() method will be invoked in an expedient fashion. When the garbage collector finally does run, it may cause a large number of resources to be reclaimed in a short period of time, which can lead to \"bursty\" performance and lower overall system throughput. This effect becomes more pronounced as the load on the system increases.\n\nFinally, if it is possible for a resource reclamation operation to hang (if it requires communicating over a network to a database, for example), then the thread that is executing the finalize() method will hang. \n\n2. Release resources in a finally block. The code for Example 2 should be rewritten as follows:\n\n  public void execCxnSql(Connection conn) {\n    Statement stmt;\n    try {\n      stmt = conn.createStatement();\n      ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(CXN_SQL);\n      ...\n    }\n    finally {\n      if (stmt != null) {\n        safeClose(stmt);\n      }\n    }\n}\n\npublic static void safeClose(Statement stmt) {\n  if (stmt != null) {\n    try {\n      stmt.close();\n    } catch (SQLException e) {\n      log(e);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nThis solution uses a helper function to log the exceptions that might occur when trying to close the statement. Presumably this helper function will be reused whenever a statement needs to be closed. \n\nAlso, the execCxnSql method does not initialize the stmt object to null. Instead, it checks to ensure that stmt is not null before calling safeClose(). Without the null check, the Java compiler reports that stmt might not be initialized. This choice takes advantage of Java's ability to detect uninitialized variables. If  stmt is initialized to null in a more complex method, cases in which stmt is used without being initialized will not be detected by the compiler. \n\n\nTips\n\n-\n\nReferences\n\nCWE ID 404, Common Weakness Enumeration\n\nCWE ID 404, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA9 Application Denial of Service, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2004 - (OWASP 2004)\n\nRequirement 6.5.9, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.1 - (PCI 1.1)\n\nAPP6080 CAT II, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"

The data is written to an external location, such as the console, file system, or network. \n\n    In this case the data is passed to  in  at line .\n\n\nExample: The following code contains a logging statement that tracks the contents of records added to a database by storing them in a log file. Among other values that are stored, the getPassword() function returns the user-supplied plaintext password associated with the account. \n\npass = getPassword();\n...\ndbmsLog.println(id+\":\"+pass+\":\"+type+\":\"+tstamp);\n\n\nThe code in the example above logs a plaintext password to the filesystem. Although many developers trust the filesystem as a safe storage location for data, it should not be trusted implicitly, particularly when privacy is a concern. \n\nPrivate data can enter a program in a variety of ways:\n\n- Directly from the user in the form of a password or personal information\n\n- Accessed from a database or other data store by the application\n\n- Indirectly from a partner or other third party\n\nSometimes data that is not labeled as private can have a privacy implication in a different context. For example, student identification numbers are usually not considered private because there is no explicit and publicly-available mapping to an individual student's personal information. However, if a school generates identification numbers based on student social security numbers, then the identification numbers should be considered private. \n\nSecurity and privacy concerns often seem to compete with each other. From a security perspective, you should record all important operations so that any anomalous activity can later be identified. However, when private data is involved, this practice can in fact create risk. \n\nAlthough there are many ways in which private data can be handled unsafely, a common risk stems from misplaced trust. Programmers often trust the operating environment in which a program runs, and therefore believe that it is acceptable to store private information on the file system, in the registry, or in other locally-controlled resources. However, even if access to certain resources is restricted, this does not guarantee that the individuals who do have access can be trusted. For example, in 2004, an unscrupulous employee at AOL sold approximately 92 million private customer e-mail addresses to a spammer marketing an offshore gambling web site [1].\n\nIn response to such high-profile exploits, the collection and management of private data is becoming increasingly regulated. Depending on its location, the type of business it conducts, and the nature of any private data it handles, an organization may be required to comply with one or more of the following federal and state regulations:\n\n- Safe Harbor Privacy Framework [3]\n\n- Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (GLBA) [4]\n\n- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) [5]\n\n- California SB-1386 [6]\n\nDespite these regulations, privacy violations continue to occur with alarming frequency. \n\n\nRecommendations\n\nWhen security and privacy demands clash, privacy should usually be given the higher priority. To accomplish this and still maintain required security information, cleanse any private information before it exits the program.\n\nTo enforce good privacy management, develop and strictly adhere to internal privacy guidelines. The guidelines should specifically describe how an application should handle private data. If your organization is regulated by federal or state law, ensure that your privacy guidelines are sufficiently strenuous to meet the legal requirements. Even if your organization is not regulated, you must protect private information or risk losing customer confidence.\n\nThe best policy with respect to private data is to minimize its exposure. Applications, processes, and employees should not be granted access to any private data unless the access is required for the tasks that they are to perform. Just as the principle of least privilege dictates that no operation should be performed with more than the necessary privileges, access to private data should be restricted to the smallest possible group.\n\n\nTips\n\nAs part of any thorough audit for privacy violations, ensure that custom rules have been written to identify all sources of private or otherwise sensitive information entering the program.  Most sources of private data cannot be identified automatically.  Without custom rules, your check for privacy violations is likely to be substantially incomplete.\n\nThe Fortify Java Annotations FortifyPassword, FortifyNotPassword, FortifyPrivate and FortifyNotPrivate can be used to indicate which fields and variables represent passwords and private data.\n\nForitfy RTA adds protection against this category.\n\nReferences\n\nAOL man pleads guilty to selling 92m email addies, The Register, J.

            "text" : "Explanation\n\nHeader Manipulation vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\nIn this case the data enters at  in  at line . \n\n2. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without being validated.\n\nIn this case the data is sent at  in  at line .\n\nAs with many software security vulnerabilities, Header Manipulation is a means to an end, not an end in itself. At its root, the vulnerability is straightforward: an attacker passes malicious data to a vulnerable application, and the application includes the data in an HTTP response header.\n\nOne of the most common Header Manipulation attacks is HTTP Response Splitting. To mount a successful Http Response Splitting exploit, the application must allow input that contains CR (carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r) and LF (line feed, also given by %0a or \n)characters into the header. These characters not only give attackers control of the remaining headers and body of the response the application intends to send, but also allows them to create additional responses entirely under their control.\n\nExample: The following code segment reads the name of the author of a weblog entry, author, from an HTTP request and sets it in a cookie header of an HTTP response. \n\nString author = request.getParameter(AUTHOR_PARAM);\n...\nCookie cookie = new Cookie(\"author\", author);\n     cookie.setMaxAge(cookieExpiration);\n     response.addCookie(cookie);\n\n\nAssuming a string consisting of standard alpha-numeric characters, such as \"Jane Smith\", is submitted in the request the HTTP response including this cookie might take the following form:\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n...\nSet-Cookie: author=Jane Smith\n...\n\n\nHowever, because the value of the cookie is formed of unvalidated user input the response will only maintain this form if the value submitted for AUTHOR_PARAM does not contain any CR and LF characters. If an attacker submits a malicious string, such as \"Wiley Hacker\\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\\r\n...\", then the HTTP response would be split into two responses of the following form:\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n...\nSet-Cookie: author=Wiley Hacker\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n...\n\n\nClearly, the second response is completely controlled by the attacker and can be constructed with any header and body content desired. The ability of attacker to construct arbitrary HTTP responses permits a variety of resulting attacks, including: cross-user defacement, web and browser cache poisoning, cross-site scripting and page hijacking. \n\nCross-User Defacement: An attacker can make a single request to a vulnerable server that will cause the server to create two responses, the second of which may be misinterpreted as a response to a different request, possibly one made by another user sharing the same TCP connection with the server. This can be accomplished by convincing the user to submit the malicious request themselves, or remotely in situations where the attacker and the user share a common TCP connection to the server, such as a shared proxy server. In the best case, an attacker can leverage this ability to convince users that the application has been hacked, causing users to lose confidence in the security of the application. In the worst case, an attacker may provide specially crafted content designed to mimic the behavior of the application but redirect private information, such as account numbers and passwords, back to the attacker.\n\nCache Poisoning: The impact of a maliciously constructed response can be magnified if it is cached either by a web cache used by multiple users or even the browser cache of a single user. If a response is cached in a shared web cache, such as those commonly found in proxy servers, then all users of that cache will continue receive the malicious content until the cache entry is purged. Similarly, if the response is cached in the browser of an individual user, then that user will continue to receive the malicious content until the cache entry is purged, although only the user of the local browser instance will be affected. \n\nCross-Site Scripting: Once attackers have control of the responses sent by an application, they have a choice of a variety of malicious content to provide users. Cross-site scripting is common form of attack where malicious JavaScript or other code included in a response is executed in the user's browser. The variety of attacks based on XSS is almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting private data like cookies or other session information to the attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site. The most common and dangerous attack vector against users of a vulnerable application uses JavaScript to transmit session and authentication information back to the attacker who can then take complete control of the victim's account. \n\nPage Hijacking: In addition to using a vulnerable application to send malicious content to a user, the same root vulnerability can also be leveraged to redirect sensitive content generated by the server and intended for the user to the attacker instead. By submitting a request that results in two responses, the intended response from the server and the response generated by the attacker, an attacker can cause an intermediate node, such as a shared proxy server, to misdirect a response generated by the server for the user to the attacker. Because the request made by the attacker generates two responses, the first is interpreted as a response to the attacker's request, while the second remains in limbo. When the user makes a legitimate request through the same TCP connection, the attacker's request is already waiting and is interpreted as a response to the victim's request. The attacker then sends a second request to the server, to which the proxy server responds with the server generated request intended for the victim, thereby compromising any sensitive information in the headers or body of the response intended for the victim.\n\nCookie Manipulation: When combined with attacks like Cross-Site Request Forgery, attackers can change, add to, or even overwrite a legitimate user's cookies.\n\nOpen Redirect: Allowing unvalidated input to control the URL used in a redirect can aid phishing attacks.\n\nMany of today's modern application servers will prevent the injection of malicious characters into HTTP headers. For example, recent versions of Apache Tomcat will throw an IllegalArgumentException if you attempt to set a header with prohibited characters. If your application server prevents setting headers with new line characters, then your application is not vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting. However, solely filtering for new line characters can leave an application vulnerable to Cookie Manipulation or Open Redirects, so care must still be taken when setting HTTP headers with user input.\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe solution to Header Manipulation is to ensure that input validation occurs in the correct places and checks for the correct properties.\n\nSince Header Manipulation vulnerabilities occur when an application includes malicious data in its output, one logical approach is to validate data immediately before it leaves the application. However, because web applications often have complex and intricate code for generating responses dynamically, this method is prone to errors of omission (missing validation). An effective way to mitigate this risk is to also perform input validation for Header Manipulation.\n\nWeb applications must validate their input to prevent other vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, so augmenting an application's existing input validation mechanism to include checks for Header Manipulation is generally relatively easy. Despite its value, input validation for Header Manipulation does not take the place of rigorous output validation. An application may accept input through a shared data store or other trusted source, and that data store may accept input from a source that does not perform adequate input validation. Therefore, the application cannot implicitly rely on the safety of this or any other data. This means the best way to prevent Header Manipulation vulnerabilities is to validate everything that enters the application or leaves the application destined for the user.\n\nThe most secure approach to validation for Header Manipulation is to create a whitelist of safe characters that are allowed to appear in HTTP response headers and accept input composed exclusively of characters in the approved set. For example, a valid name might only include alpha-numeric characters or an account number might only include digits 0-9.\n\nA more flexible, but less secure approach is known as blacklisting, which selectively rejects or escapes potentially dangerous characters before using the input. In order to form such a list, you first need to understand the set of characters that hold special meaning in HTTP response headers. Although the CR and LF characters are at the heart of an HTTP response splitting attack, other characters, such as ':' (colon) and '=' (equal), have special meaning in response headers as well.\n\nOnce you identify the correct points in an application to perform validation for Header Manipulation attacks and what special characters the validation should consider, the next challenge is to identify how your validation handles special characters. The application should reject any input destined to be included in HTTP response headers that contains special characters, particularly CR and LF, as invalid.\n\nMany application servers attempt to limit an application's exposure to HTTP response splitting vulnerabilities by providing implementations for the functions responsible for setting HTTP headers and cookies that perform validation for the characters essential to an HTTP response splitting attack. Do not rely on the server running your application to make it secure. When an application is developed there are no guarantees about what application servers it will run on during its lifetime. As standards and known exploits evolve, there are no guarantees that application servers will also stay in sync.\n\nTips\n\nMany <code>HttpServletRequest</code> implementations return a URL-encoded string from <code>getHeader()</code>, will not cause a HTTP response splitting issue unless it is decoded first because the CR and LF characters will not carry a meta-meaning in their encoded form. However, this behavior is not specified in the J2EE standard and varies by implementation. Furthermore, even encoded user input returned from <code>getHeader()</code> can lead to other vulnerabilities, including open redirects and other HTTP header tampering.\n\nForitfy RTA adds protection against this category.\n\nReferences\n\nDivide and Conquer: HTTP Response Splitting, Web Cache Poisoning Attacks, and Related Topics, A.

Structured logging facilities provide features like logging levels, uniform formatting, a logger identifier, timestamps, and, perhaps most critically, the ability to direct the log messages to the right place. When the use of system output streams is jumbled together with the code that uses loggers properly, the result is often a well-kept log that is missing critical information.\n\nDevelopers widely accept the need for structured logging, but many continue to use system output streams in their \"pre-production\" development. If the code you are reviewing is past the initial phases of development, use of System.out or System.err may indicate an oversight in the move to a structured logging system.\n\nRecommendations\n\nUse a Java logging facility rather than System.out or System.err. \n\nExample 2: For example, the \"hello world\" program above can be re-written using log4j like this:\n\nimport org.apache.log4j.Logger;\nimport org.apache.log4j.BasicConfigurator;\n\npublic class MyClass {\n  private final static Logger logger =     \n            Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class);\n\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    BasicConfigurator.configure();\n    logger.info(\"hello world\");\n  }\n}\n\n\nTips\n\n-\n\nReferences\n\nCWE ID 398, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA7 Improper Error Handling, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2004 - (OWASP 2004)\n\nA6 Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2007 - (OWASP 2007)\n\nRequirement 6.5.7, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.1 - (PCI 1.1)\n\nRequirement 6.3.1.2, 6.5.6, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.2 - (PCI 1.2)\n\nAPP3620 CAT II, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"

The finalize() method for FileInputStream eventually calls close(), but there is no guarantee as to how long it will take before the finalize() method will be invoked. In a busy environment, this can result in the JVM using up all of its file handles.\n\nprivate void processFile(String fName) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException\n{\n  FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(fName);\n  int sz;\n  byte[] byteArray = new byte[BLOCK_SIZE];\n  while ((sz = fis.read(byteArray)) != -1) {\n    processBytes(byteArray, sz);\n  }\n}\n\n\nExample 2: Under normal conditions, the following code executes a database query, processes the results returned by the database, and closes the allocated statement object. But if an exception occurs while executing the SQL or processing the results, the statement object will not be closed. If this happens often enough, the database will run out of available cursors and not be able to execute any more SQL queries.\n\n  Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();\n  ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(CXN_SQL);\n  harvestResults(rs);\n  stmt.close();\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\n1. Never rely on finalize() to reclaim resources. In order for an object's finalize() method to be invoked, the garbage collector must determine that the object is eligible for garbage collection. Because the garbage collector is not required to run unless the JVM is low on memory, there is no guarantee that an object's finalize() method will be invoked in an expedient fashion. When the garbage collector finally does run, it may cause a large number of resources to be reclaimed in a short period of time, which can lead to \"bursty\" performance and lower overall system throughput. This effect becomes more pronounced as the load on the system increases.\n\nFinally, if it is possible for a resource reclamation operation to hang (if it requires communicating over a network to a database, for example), then the thread that is executing the finalize() method will hang. \n\n2. Release resources in a finally block. The code for Example 2 should be rewritten as follows:\n\n  public void execCxnSql(Connection conn) {\n    Statement stmt;\n    try {\n      stmt = conn.createStatement();\n      ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(CXN_SQL);\n      ...\n    }\n    finally {\n      if (stmt != null) {\n        safeClose(stmt);\n      }\n    }\n}\n\npublic static void safeClose(Statement stmt) {\n  if (stmt != null) {\n    try {\n      stmt.close();\n    } catch (SQLException e) {\n      log(e);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nThis solution uses a helper function to log the exceptions that might occur when trying to close the statement. Presumably this helper function will be reused whenever a statement needs to be closed. \n\nAlso, the execCxnSql method does not initialize the stmt object to null. Instead, it checks to ensure that stmt is not null before calling safeClose(). Without the null check, the Java compiler reports that stmt might not be initialized. This choice takes advantage of Java's ability to detect uninitialized variables. If  stmt is initialized to null in a more complex method, cases in which stmt is used without being initialized will not be detected by the compiler. \n\n\nTips\n\n-\n\nReferences\n\nCWE ID 404, Common Weakness Enumeration\n\nCWE ID 404, Standards Mapping - Common Weakness Enumeration - (CWE)\n\nA9 Application Denial of Service, Standards Mapping - OWASP Top 10 2004 - (OWASP 2004)\n\nRequirement 6.5.9, Standards Mapping - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 1.1 - (PCI 1.1)\n\nAPP6080 CAT II, Standards Mapping - Security Technical Implementation Guide Version 2 - (STIG 2)\n  \nCopyright (c) 2024 Open Text\n"
